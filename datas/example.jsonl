The intellect can then point out to the emotions that by doing Z, they can get Y; again, the anxiety will transfer. In this manner, anxiety flows down the chains of desire formed by the intellect .

The pressures involved are not just of time but also of uncertainty, in that producers have to react to unpredictable occurrences both within the event and external to it. Thus, the game itself may be unscripted, but the production of the sporting event is as organized as possible.

{"keyword":"Neuroscience, Retraining the brain to reduce worry","type":"binkan","full_paragraph":"Curiously, we seem to be born to worry \u2014 perhaps an artifact of ancient memories carried over from ancestral times when there were countless threats to our survival. However, most of the worries we have today are not about really serious threats. We can learn how to retrain our brain by interrupting these negative thoughts and fears. By redirecting our awareness to setting positive goals and building a strong, optimistic sense of accomplishment, we strengthen the areas in our frontal lobe that suppress our tendency to react to imaginary fears . Not only do we build neural circuits relating to happiness, contentment, and life satisfaction, we also strengthen specific circuits that enhance our social awareness and our ability to empathize with others. This is the ideal state in which effective communication can prosper.

{"keyword":"Psychology, person and mind perception skills","type":"binkan","full_paragraph":"In 2010, Tal Eyal of Ben-Gurion University in Israel and Nicholas Epley of the University of Chicago published the results of a series of experiments aimed at improving our person and mind perception skills. Many of our errors, the researchers found, stem from a basic mismatch between how we analyze ourselves and how we analyze others. When it comes to ourselves, we employ a fine-grained, highly contextualized level of detail. When we think about others, however, we operate at a much higher, more generalized and abstract level. For instance, when answering the same question about ourselves or others \u2014 how attractive are you? \u2014 we use very different cues. For our own appearance, we think about how our hair is looking that morning, whether we got enough sleep, how well that shirt matches our complexion. For that of others, we form a surface judgment based on overall gist                                   . So, there are two mismatches: we aren\u2019t quite sure how others are seeing us, and we are incorrectly judging how they see themselves.

{"keyword":"Film Studies, Apocalypse Now adaptation of Heart of Darkness","type":"binkan","full_paragraph":"Apocalypse Now, a film produced and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, gained widespread popularity, and for good reason. The film is an adaptation of Joseph Conrad\u2019s novel Heart of Darkness, which is set in the African Congo at the end of the 19th century. Unlike the original novel, Apocalypse Now is set in Vietnam and Cambodia during the Vietnam War. The setting, time period, dialogue and other incidental details are changed but the fundamental narrative and themes of Apocalypse Now are the same as those of Heart of Darkness. Both describe a physical journey, reflecting the central character\u2019s mental and spiritual journey, down a river to confront the deranged Kurtz character, who represents the worst aspects of civilisation. By giving Apocalypse Now a setting that was contemporary at the time of its release, audiences were able to experience and identify with its themes more easily than they would have if the film had been a literal adaptation of the novel .

The gifted learn to play magnificent Mozart melodies and beautiful Beethoven symphonies, but never compose their own scores. They focus their energy on consuming existing scientific knowledge, not producing new insights. They conform to the codified rules of established games, rather than inventing their own rules or their own games.

If perfection is a state beyond improvement, then isn\u2019t every moment, by definition, perfect? After all, any given \"now,\" any given moment of reality is what it is in the sense that it cannot be anything other than what it is. Take this moment, right now: this moment is already here, and, as such, as theoretically imperfect as it may be, it is \u2014 at present \u2014 beyond any modification . While you could take the lessons of this moment and try to make the next moment better, this very moment is beyond improvement. It is too late to add anything to this moment to make it better.

A good walking staff was the ultimate assistive device. If you misstepped, the staff helped you regain your balance. If you became tired, the staff was there to support you. The staff offered the benefit of a probe if you needed to explore an unfamiliar object along the way. It could be used as a gauge to test the depth of water if you had to ford a stream. If you needed to commit something to memory, you could notch the information down on the staff more or less with the same ease as we do it with the flash-drive memory sticks of today.

But when you see one of his films, you may wonder how that could be. This assessment comes largely from those who saw him perform live. He was an amazing and brilliant technician who took big risks and thrilled audiences far enough away not to be able to sense his technique. He rarely reached that impact on film where his work sometimes looks calculated. Richard Burton, also respected as one of the twentieth-century greats, had a voice so huge that it would sometimes overwhelm the camera, the microphone, and all the intimacy of film acting. To this day, many audience members and critics maintain that if you did not experience either of these men in the theatre , you did not experience their magic.

For the first time in history, when governments, corporations and private individuals consider their immediate future, many of them don\u2019t think about war as a likely event. Nuclear weapons have turned war between superpowers into a mad act of collective suicide, and therefore forced the most powerful nations on earth to find alternative and peaceful ways to resolve conflicts. Simultaneously, the global economy has been transformed from a material-based economy into a knowledge-based economy. Previously the main sources of wealth were material assets such as gold mines, wheat fields and oil wells. Today the main source of wealth is knowledge. And whereas you can conquer oil fields through war, you cannot acquire knowledge that way. Hence as knowledge became the most important economic resource, the profitability of war declined and wars became increasingly restricted to those parts of the world where the economies are still old-fashioned material-based economies.

This is not to say that it does not exist, but rather that we cannot be absolutely sure we have found it simply because we have an apparently logical proof . People make mistakes, particularly when checking a single lengthy argument repeatedly. Our knowledge of the truth of a mathematical statement depends upon making judgements based upon appropriate evidence. This evidence includes proofs of the type presented in text books, but may also involve numerical calculations, already solved special cases, geometrical pictures, consistency with one\u2019s intuition about the field, parallels with other fields, wholly unexpected consequences which can be verified, etc. Mathematicians try to increase their knowledge, but this knowledge is based more upon the variety of independent sources of confirmation than upon logic.

This is a fatal assumption that will only result in confusion and frustration for your reader. Also, a great deal of your time will be spent generating additional messages to the reader trying to explain what should have been clear the first time.

They cannot connect to more readers unless they expand their own views and writing topics. That does not mean that they have to change their genre, but they certainly need to attempt to improve upon that genre with each and every book that they offer to the public. Even when you look at popular movie franchises or television shows, they run their courses after a while. No matter how successful a writer becomes, they have to change things up from time to time .

Evil is always a weakness, and virtue is always strength, even if things appear to be quite the opposite (a tyrant, and men tortured by a tyrant). A tyrant is, although he does not know it, weaker than the person who, fully aware of what is happening, allows himself to be killed by tyrants.

If place identity is tied to a particular industry, local residents may feel strongly attached to the definitions of place that stem from involvement in that industry, and they may resist losing that identity in favor of one based on a tourism industry. People rooted in landscape may feel strong connections to other community members and may resent the invasion of outsiders who they believe are different and challenge their common identity. Finally, local residents may feel that this process reduces their identities to mere commercial transactions, and they may believe they sacrifice what is unique and special about their place.
