He created a short film in which he showed the expressionless face of an actor followed by a bowl of soup, then the face and a dead child, then the face and a beautiful woman. Kuleshov showed this film to different audiences, some of whom were told that the actor had been asked to imagine each situation before making his expressionless face. Other audiences were told nothing about how it was made. The first group said that the actor’s changeless expression was so nuanced that they could see hunger, grief, and desire in his eyes. The second group said he looked “unexpressive.” Both groups had been shown the same footage — only their context was different.",

For example, if someone is not nice to you, you may feel hurt. This feeling comes from the energy that is released when you remember all the times someone was not nice to you in the past.

If you don’t know what a character wants, and can’t see them doing anything to try to get it, the character isn’t really there at all. The great writer and teacher Lajos Egri put it this way: ‘Every well-drawn character must have a purpose, an objective. He must be active, striving towards his goal.’ This makes sense because — as we’ve seen above — stories are essentially about conflict: the obstacles that prevent people from getting what they want. In a sense, obstacles are more important than the things that are being sought. In The Old Man And The Sea (1952) by Ernest Hemingway it is not just the marlin that is being sought; it’s also, and more importantly, self-respect for Santiago.

In other words, willpower is a finite resource and can run out . A classic study of parole board decisions in 2011 found that prisoners appearing in the morning had a 70 percent chance of being released, while those appearing late in the day had only a 10 percent chance.

The degree of uncertainty in any measurement is an inherent limitation on its accuracy. It is impossible to measure anything with an accuracy greater than the uncertainty associated with the measurement.

Instead, you can use category-based induction: you know that some features of people are more common than others and that the features of people are related. So if you know anything about one person, you can assume that your new friend shares some features. This is not only faster, but also builds on what you already know.

That is why many observers feared that a world dominated by a few superpowers would be a world at war, in which each of these powers would fight to dominate the others.

The use of concrete objects should be a bridge between the abstract concepts of mathematics and their real-world applications. In other words, while working with concrete materials, children should be thinking about mathematical ideas, not just playing with the toys. For example, when counting a pile of blocks, young children may end up recounting blocks they have already counted because they are not yet able to keep track of what they have already counted.

Members of social groups are not just isolated individuals; they participate in specific ways of life, and one of the main features of such ways of life is shared eating practices. Foods and drinks are thus imbued with cultural meanings and can be thought of as the material markers of group identity. This is why a person who wants to express his or her belonging to a particular group may choose to consume a specific type of food or drink, or to avoid other types of food or drink. For example, members of certain religious groups may choose to only eat certain kinds of meat, while others may avoid alcohol. This can have important implications for the way that people relate to one another on a day-to-day basis. The preference for particular foods over others can mark out social distinctions between ‘us’ and ‘them’.",

These patterns are initially carved in the short term or working memory, and if we keep attending to or rehearsing them, they become more strongly imprinted in the long-term memory. They are stored in a way that depends highly on their content and meaning. For example, if two experiences share some content or meaning (e.g., “cat”), their patterns will overlap. If they do not share any content or meaning (e.g., “cat” and “dog”), then their patterns will not overlap. This means that if we have a brain injury that removes part of a pattern for one experience (e.g., a car accident that results in amnesia — loss of memory — for some specific event), we may still be able to remember other events well (e.g., remembering what we had for lunch). The reason is that only part of the pattern was erased by the injury, so some other part of the pattern can still act as a retrieval cue for the rest of the pattern.",

When we justify our decision to eat meat, we often say that there is something special about humans, or at least mammals, that means they have moral value while other creatures do not. But if we can live without killing animals for food, those justifications start to look hollow. We like to think that our diets are somehow “natural,” but in reality most of us get our meat from factory farms where animals are treated as commodities rather than living beings.

For example, some people argue that human beings have biological or genetic tendencies to behave in certain ways that transcend cultural boundaries. People who hold this position believe that our genes determine our behavior and that our genes are responsible for why we act as we do. They would argue that some behaviors result from biological differences between men and women that lead to different paths taken by males and females in their lives. This view opposes the idea that society shapes us more than biology does.",

This was a big problem for computer scientists at the time: how can multiple users access and edit documents stored on a single hard drive? When developing these new systems, they took different approaches: the first approach was to enforce an exclusive lock on the file (busy wait): if a user is editing it, all other users must wait until he is done. The second approach was to copy files for each user that wants to modify it. This second approach (used in Google Docs) is called optimistic concurrency control (OCC).

This can have a profound effect on which crops become more profitable to produce.

According to this line of reasoning, people attend sports events to experience a sense of collective identity and to feel connected to other fans. Durkheim also suggested that people are naturally drawn to social interaction, and we see evidence of this today in the popularity of sports bars and restaurants where we can watch games with other fans. Furthermore, sociologists have argued that we often use sports as a way to connect with others in our everyday lives. For example, imagine you run into someone who attended the same college as you but whom you have never met before. If you learn that the person shares your passion for your college’s team, it is likely that you will feel an immediate sense of friendship with this person, despite the fact that you have nothing else in common.",

Africans have a greater number of different alleles than any other subgroup of humans, and they have more diversity within their subgroups. This means that the first movements out of Africa were also the most genetically diverse. There was considerable gene flow between people leaving Africa and those already living in other parts of the world. This gene flow has resulted in a general decrease in genetic diversity as one traces the path from Africa to other parts of the world. Both the number of alleles and within-group diversity have decreased with distance from Africa, because emigrants carried only a portion of the total human variation with them when they left Africa. Over time, these small numbers have been further reduced by natural selection, mutation, and drift.",

Its length and its form are two of the things that distinguish it from other literary genres. But there are other important ways in which the novel is different from other kinds of writing. One way is that it represents the world as being very much like the world we live in; novels usually feature plausible characters who speak and behave as people do in real life. This is one reason why novels are often taken to be representative of particular periods or cultures: because they mirror the world as it is, they can be seen to offer insights into the world as it was at a particular time, and as a result they have been used to teach readers about history or politics or ethics. The novel’s commitment to representing reality has not changed over time; even novels that seem to be wildly different from one another (like a romance novel and an adventure novel) share this quality, which we might call “realism.”",

The director’s job is to supervise and coordinate the activities of everyone on the set. However, not all directors are known for their writing ability or their visual style.

That’s why many people argue that it is essential to think in terms of trade-offs when considering government services such as education and health care. However, there are some important exceptions to this rule. One might be if the provision of a particular service increased productivity in society as a whole. For instance, when Milton Friedman famously said “there’s no such thing as a free lunch,” he meant that even if something appeared to be costless (for example, someone else was paying for your lunch), it would still have an opportunity cost for society as a whole because resources are being diverted from other uses.

Seligman found that dogs who had been put in situations where they had no control over their outcomes became passive when confronted with situations in which they did have control. When Dweck conducted similar studies with people, she observed similar results: individuals who believed that their talents were fixed were less likely to take on challenges than those who believed that they could change their talents through hard work. This notion — that our abilities are malleable rather than fixed — has come to be known as an “incremental” theory of intelligence or ability. The resulting belief system can strongly influence how people learn and perform.

One explanation for this pattern is that predominantly white, middle-class neighborhoods are especially likely to be highly transient, which reduces the time available for social interaction and the development of trust. The presence of many strangers also increases the likelihood that these strangers will be viewed with suspicion rather than as potential friends or allies.

The fan base creates an economic interest in the art: it becomes a source of income for those who control it; and this income depends on maintaining and expanding that fan base.

Writing had an enormous impact on the development of human societies. It allowed for more complex forms of political organization, trade and commerce, and the development of new technologies. However, it also led to a dramatic decline in the use of oral communication. The loss of this skill has been a source of concern for many writers. One recent author (who is also a university professor) suggests that universities should do more to promote good communication skills amongst their students. He argues that today’s students are incapable of thinking creatively because they have never had to engage with their peers in debate, or remember the details of a good story. On the other hand, there are those who say that we should not be too concerned because people are now able to communicate with each other almost instantaneously by means of the World Wide Web.",

The ultimate goal of these algorithms is to improve patient care by identifying critical findings more accurately and efficiently than radiologists. While the goal of these algorithms is laudable, it is important to recognize that current roles of radiologists will not be completely replaced by machine learning.

Unfortunately, there are many factors that can interfere with the bleaching process and make it difficult to get your clothes clean. There are three kinds of substances that interfere with the bleaching process: fillers, hard water, and other metals like iron and copper. Most laundry detergents contain fillers to bulk up the product and hold all the other ingredients together. These fillers tie up the active ingredients in the detergent so they can’t do their job properly. Hard water also ties up active ingredients in laundry detergents so they can’t do their job properly. Water hardness is caused by dissolved calcium and magnesium salts in water. Other metals like iron, copper, or manganese are also found in water supplies and can interfere with bleach cleaning action.

By age eight, children may become more aware of the nature of advertisements, but this knowledge may not be enough to counteract their influence. In a study conducted by psychologist Michael Jacobson and his colleagues, young children were offered a choice between two candies, one with a “Power Rangers” wrapper and one with an ordinary wrapper. Most children chose the “Power Rangers” candy, even though they had tasted both candies in advance and shown no preference before they saw the wrappers.

For instance, exercise increases metabolic rate and produces heat. In addition, when you feel cold, your body automatically starts shivering to produce heat. Shivering is the result of rapid muscle contractions in which very little movement actually occurs; the energy from this muscular activity is converted to body heat. Similarly, if you enter a very hot environment, sweating will occur to cool the body by evaporation of sweat from your skin. These mechanisms can be very effective in controlling body temperature based on the environmental situation. A brief exposure to an extreme temperature (hot or cold) often creates an immediate sense of comfort when you return to the “normal” temperature range. One hypothesis for why brief exposure to extreme temperatures creates this sense of comfort is that it forces your body to use its natural mechanisms for temperature control, thereby turning up the heating or cooling system that has become less sensitive through lack of use.",

For instance, if I am a teacher and I am also the mother of an infant, I can use what I know about being a good teacher to help me become a good mother.

Securely attached infants tended to score high on measures of sympathy and helping toward others; however, they also scored higher on measures of resistance to adult control and a tendency to act in a self-centered manner.

Social memories can take many forms, and they can be based on different types of information. In some species, individuals can recognize one another solely through smell. Other animals remember others by their vocalizations; still others are able to discriminate among members of their group based on visual features such as fur color and other patterns.

In contrast, people who strongly hold intrinsic values—the belief that nature has an inherent value—tend to see nature as something to be preserved. The problem, according to the psychological research, is that in Western societies today, extrinsic values dominate over intrinsic values. This means that sustainability messages—ones that emphasize the need to preserve nature because it has an inherent value—are going to fall on deaf ears for many people. Instead, the research suggests that it might be more effective to use messages that appeal to extrinsic values, such as those related to status or financial gain. This may seem counterintuitive because it is inconsistent with many people’s deeply held beliefs about what motivates them. But the research suggests that for many people, these kinds of messages are more likely to have an impact than ones related to intrinsic values.",

The right balance of sugar can be achieved by adding about 14% of sugar to a typical ice cream recipe. This results in a product with a smooth texture that is neither too sweet nor too grainy . The amount of sugar used can also be used to control the hardness or softness of an ice cream . As more sugar is added, the freezing point of the mix will drop and less air can be incorporated into the mix during freezing .

This site, which had been made famous by the work of Louis and Mary Leakey, revealed the existence of a sophisticated society that lived more than 2 million years ago. Tools are proof that an individual or group of individuals had the ability to manipulate their surroundings and fashion devices for specific purposes. The existence of tools demonstrates a progression from the earliest humans (Homo habilis; “Handy Man”) who lacked the capability to make tools, to Homo erectus (“Upright Man”), who did have this ability. These early humans were able to use stone choppers and pounders as well as wooden spears for hunting small game. The discovery of these tools was a turning point in human history. It marked the first step on the road to human civilization, the point at which humans ceased being simply another species within the animal kingdom and began their journey toward becoming masters of their world.",

It is, therefore, not surprising that the Roman historian Pliny should make note of India’s ‘love’ for gold. But what he observed in terms of Roman trade with India was not gold but silver. It has been suggested that Roman silver coins were introduced into south Asia at this time to facilitate trade between Roman and Indian merchants. This suggestion is supported by the fact that Roman silver coins were found in excavations at various sites located on the west coast of India (Kaveripakkam, Arikamedu and Alagankulam).

In this case, the larger the group, the less likely that any given individual will be attacked, for if a predator succeeds in capturing one monkey, it will have to spend time eating it, and all the other monkeys will have an opportunity to escape. Thus, over time, primates that lived in groups may have had a selective advantage in comparison to solitary primates. But if this is true, why didn’t all primates come to live in groups? The answer seems to be at least partly because of the costs of living in a large group. Some of these costs include increased competition among individuals for food and mates; increased danger from diseases that can spread more easily through populations of close contact; and increased risk of being detected by predators when feeding or traveling together.",

By contrast, in today’s society, children are primarily socialized among peers rather than adults. This leads them to develop a separate culture that is often at odds with the values of the adult society. This culture has its heroes, its myths, its values, and its heroes that are distinct from the adult society. In other words, as children move into adolescence and young adulthood they are increasingly socialized by other people who are like themselves rather than by older people who have more experience of life.",

These include smiling, crying and following, all of which are designed to make sure that they receive attention.

By comparing all future copies with this edition, scholars could see where mistakes had been made in its production, and they could also establish which manuscripts were closest to the original text.

Once their form is agreed upon, these drawings serve as models for the production of the work, which will generally have to be made quickly and without substantial alterations because the artist’s time is valuable and not easily replaced.

Kuhn suggests that scientists operate within a set of shared beliefs about how the world works (or what he calls a paradigm) that determines the questions they ask and what they consider to be legitimate ways to answer those questions. Within this framework, scientists are often engaged in filling in details and refining their understanding. But every so often ― and it’s hard to predict when it will happen ― some observation or new piece of technology comes along that just doesn’t fit with what the current paradigm says should happen. Scientists try to integrate this new information into their existing framework, but eventually it becomes clear that there is no easy way to do so. Instead, scientists must come up with a new way of thinking about the world, one that is informed by all the data that have been gathered before but that can also incorporate this new piece of information.",

That way, the scientists didn’t have to debate whether a strange-looking object moving in one of the photographs was alive—they’d know it was alive only if they found actual evidence of life (chemicals) produced by it. In this case, there was no single experiment or set of observations that could either prove or disprove the hypothesis that there is life on Mars.

Because natural selection is the process by which traits become more common if they benefit individual survival and reproduction, studying the survival value of animal behaviors helps us understand how these behaviors evolved.",

The idea that emotions are good for memory has been around for a long time, and it fits well with our feelings about strong emotional events. However, there is very little evidence to support this idea. Of course you often remember emotional events well, but you tend to remember other kinds of events well too. In fact your arousal level has very little to do with how well you remember an event. In one study people skydived from an airplane; their arousal at that moment was probably as high as it ever would be in a normal situation, yet they remembered almost none of the details of the experience afterwards. What was happening was so unusual that they couldn’t relate it to anything else they knew, so they had nothing to help them understand what was going on or to help them remember it later on.",

Consequently, we use musical taste to project the kind of person we want others to think we are: sophisticated, rebellious, hip, popular, etc. In many cases, we choose music that is consistent with our peers’ tastes as a way of fitting in.

By the end of the Roman Empire, it had become the preferred writing surface in Europe and Egypt. Unfortunately, the reasons for this shift are not entirely clear; papyrus remained in use for centuries after parchment became popular. One reason that some have suggested is that it took time for Europeans to learn how to prepare animal skins so that they could replace papyrus as a writing medium.

There may be some latitude within these strictures ― a still life can be a little bit out of focus, say, or one object can be dimly lit while another is brightly lit ― but if these and other rules are violated too much or too often, then the painting ceases to be a still life. Modernist artists revolted against these strictures just as surely as their counterparts in philosophy, science and religion revolted against theirs. So they began to treat paintings as if they were not any particular kind of picture at all.",

The announcement was based on an experiment known as OPERA (Oscillation Project with Emulsion-tRacking Apparatus), which involved sending a beam of neutrinos from CERN in Switzerland to the Gran Sasso laboratory 732 kilometers away. The OPERA team found that the neutrinos arrived at Gran Sasso about 60 nanoseconds ahead of when light would have arrived. The result was surprising, to say the least, because it contradicted a cornerstone of modern physics: Einstein’s special theory of relativity, which says that nothing can travel faster than light. There was no obvious explanation for the result, and for several months it was unclear whether it would hold up to scrutiny.",

Through this process, any variation that confers even a slight advantage (in terms of survival and reproduction) upon its owner will become more common in subsequent generations , whereas variations that confer disadvantages will become rarer.

If we keep the same conditions (for instance, 20% fat and 11% solids non-fat), and we vary only the sucrose content from 10% to 18%, then we will have significantly different results. The sugar present will make it easier to obtain a more viscous flow and smaller ice crystals. The result is that we achieve better texture stability when eating the final product: it melts more slowly. As a consequence of this, we have an increase in softness and creaminess which are much appreciated by consumers. The addition of certain sweeteners like glucose or corn syrup will have different effects because they do not inhibit crystallization as much as sucrose does; consequently they produce a more gritty product with less sensory properties.",

In Canadian rinks, for example, there is much more space behind the nets because the Canadian ice rink is 10 percent larger than its American counterpart. Because of this extra space behind the nets, an NHL team playing in a Canadian city can adjust to that extra space by instructing their forwards to come around behind their own net to pick up the puck.

You didn’t even have to have any milk or oil. Just add water, beat it up, put it in a pan, and bake it. A lot of families embraced cake mix powders in their first two years on the market, but soon sales began to decline rapidly. In an attempt to find out why, General Mills hired a psychologist named Ernest Dichter to investigate. Dichter discovered that housewives were feeling guilty about using cake mix powders because it felt like they were cheating somehow — as if they hadn’t really done anything at all.

But this concept of time is not supported by modern physics. According to Einstein’s special theory of relativity, time passes more slowly in a strong gravitational field than in a weak one. And according to the general theory of relativity, there are no such things as gravitational fields! What we think of as gravity is actually the warping and bending of space and time by matter.

In contrast, a newly built house in an undeveloped area will lack amenities and be worth less than an equivalent house in an established neighborhood.

In this book, Cochrane argued that American agriculture had been in crisis since World War I due to the fact that it had undergone a technological revolution that led to an increase in productivity and output per unit of land and labor but at the same time led to a dramatic fall in prices received by farmers. According to Cochrane, American agriculture was locked into a \"technology treadmill\" that required it to constantly innovate by adopting new technologies that raised productivity and output at an even faster rate than before just to maintain its constant income . In effect, Cochrane argued that there is no substitute for growth; when prices fall, farmers need to grow more food and fiber just to keep their income constant.",

In other words, European traders and consumers wanted better things, and this drove their search for new markets. This also helps explain why the British were so keen on tea from China in the eighteenth century.

After receiving another piece of food by chance while standing at this end of its cage, it tended to stand there even more frequently than before.

If she is outside the herd, there may be some confusion as all the mares respond to the distress call and they may also start to move. In view of this, it would be advantageous for a mother and offspring to have an individual-specific recognition signal which could be used in these circumstances. Zebras seem to have evolved precisely such a signal. The individual recognition signal is an auditory one; it is thought that each zebra has a unique vocal signature which its relatives can recognize.

These flasks allowed air to get at the broth but kept dust from getting into it. The broth remained clear for many months and even years, even though air had gotten at it.

This is a common theme in international conflicts, where countries often express a view that the actions of their historical enemy are a threat to national security and must be countered, even if this means the use of military force. The perception of mutual threat is likely to lead to increased levels of discrimination, prejudice, and hostility toward members of the opposing group, and to a desire for social distance from them. However, such negative feelings are likely to be reduced when there are opportunities for positive intergroup contact. Contact is said to be positive when it leads to reduced prejudice and discrimination arising from a feeling of mutual respect between members of different groups. The more frequent and meaningful this contact (for example, working together in mixed groups) the more likely it is that members of different groups will come to see themselves as belonging to a wider, more inclusive category, which may reduce their perceptions of competition with each other.",

Viewing tulips as a luxury item, Dutch traders drove up the price of bulbs by purchasing them at higher and higher rates. At its peak in February 1637, a single bulb could fetch half a fortune: 10,000 guilders, roughly the cost of a large house on one of Amsterdam’s most fashionable canals. As with many other bubbles throughout history, however, it was only a matter of time before people realized that there was no real value underlying the price inflation. When people stopped buying tulips in such high numbers, prices plummeted and many investors lost substantial amounts of money as a result. This period is now known as \"tulip mania\" and serves as a cautionary tale about how an asset’s price can detach from its intrinsic value when people are influenced more by speculation than by any real-world factors.",

One study found that a person’s genetic makeup accounts for 50 percent of their level of happiness, and another study found that this figure could be as high as 80 percent. This means that our basic personality traits have a profound influence on our experiences of life. It’s true that we can find ways to increase our level of happiness, but we all have a “set point” for happiness — a natural level that we will inevitably return to, even after negative events or experiences. However, given the importance of our genetics in determining our happiness, why did evolution not select for us all to be happy all the time? It’s simply because the “happy gene” is not always beneficial to survival and reproduction. As with other traits such as intelligence and creativity, it’s variation in personality that promotes the success of the species — and so we need some people who are less happy than others.",

The best way to reach truth is through doubt and skepticism. So why do people so often resist doubt? One reason is that, on a personal level, it feels bad. Doubt is an uncomfortable state; it makes us feel vulnerable and insecure. And on a social level, we are often rewarded for maintaining our current belief systems and are threatened with social and material punishments if we don’t ― for example, when we refuse to believe in our parents’ religious faith or when we question a groupthink consensus among our peers at work.

But why do females prefer such elaborate displays? One explanation is that they are getting a good estimate of what a male will be like when he eventually becomes a parent. Another possibility is that the attractiveness of such a structure suggests that there is good habitat nearby, which will be important to her when she needs to find food for her offspring. Perhaps these two explanations are really the same: A male who can collect lots of blue objects or who can defend his bower against other males may also be adept at finding food or defending territory when he becomes a parent.",

They may have been raised by strict parents who didn’t allow them to express feelings or make decisions. Or they may have been raised by liberal parents who gave them too many choices.

When you are like this, it is difficult for you to develop the confidence and skills needed to raise your children in a balanced way. You may feel guilty about disciplining your child, or you may be afraid of losing control if you discipline your child too much; so you allow your child to do whatever he wants.

This reorganization is most likely to occur when damage occurs early in life. For example, if the left hemisphere is damaged during infancy or childhood as a result of a stroke or injury, then over time the right hemisphere may take over language processing functions.

The creator and listener thus shared a unique bond: the composer was creating something for that specific audience in that specific place at that specific time that would never exist in exactly that format again. It was only with the advent of sound recording technology that this changed. In 1903, opera pioneer Enrico Caruso made some of the first recordings on phonograph, and soon people were buying records rather than attending live performances. Suddenly it was possible to hear a piece of music without ever having to leave home or wait for an ensemble to perform it live. This created a new division between performance and creation, between composer and listener.",

When asked why he didn’t use a computer, he replied:  “The fact that I have to write out every single note by hand compels me to think very carefully about everything I do. There is an advantage in working slowly if you are trying to develop a new idea. It makes you ask yourself all sorts of questions, and avoid jumping to conclusions.”  In other words, by writing on paper, Messiaen was forced to think deeply about each note he wrote and all aspects of his composition. This led him to consider many possibilities before settling on any one idea, and allowed him to hone his craft. This same principle can be applied to writing with pen and paper. By slowing down the pace at which you write—because it takes longer than typing—you can gain a deeper understanding of what you are writing and improve your work as a result.",

This percentage varies from one person to the next and is influenced by age, sex, and lifestyle. In general, women carry more body fat than men ― their so-called essential fat is 3 percent of their body weight compared with 12 percent in men. Body-fat levels vary widely among individuals, but generally people are considered healthy if their body-fat level is less than 25 percent (for women) or 15 percent (for men). The average American woman has a body-fat percentage of about 30 percent, while an average man has about 22 percent.

This phenomenon is at the heart of suspense in storytelling, and it also explains why people are addicted to golf: you win only if you complete each hole. The effect is also central to the field of psychology because it demonstrates that human beings are born with a natural tendency to finish what they start. So why does the completion bias cause us to spend so much time on unimportant tasks? It turns out that our brains have a fundamental need for completion. To finish something, anything, we become driven like racehorses toward the finish line. Our brains need closure in order to deliver a hit of dopamine; otherwise we get an itch that we can’t scratch.",

By 1865, newspapers in New York City and London were using Bain’s invention to transmit images of events that had occurred thousands of miles away. The transmission of photographs by wire was an early form of electronic communication that first allowed people to receive images without having ever seen the source they were viewing.

In this way communities developed mutual interdependence among their members. If one individual or family experienced a poor crop yield due to drought or other natural causes, there was usually enough food to go around due to surplus production by others in the community, which they could trade or share with those in need . Today our global food system often works against these basic local principles by taking locally produced foods such as corn, wheat, and soybeans and transporting them over long distances to feed large populations in distant urban centers.

The answer may be that single people have fewer opportunities to limit their dating pool and still find a partner.

This is not because it is actually faster but because your perception is likely to be influenced by all the positive associations created by its rival’s marketing campaign. It is probably fair to say that this type of influence does not just happen with cars: most people’s perceptions can be influenced in a similar way by all kinds of situations and circumstances, including advertising messages.

In the cotton mill, workers are exposed to high levels of airborne fibers or dusts, while people who are not employed in cotton mills are typically exposed only to very low levels of these substances during their day-to-day activities. Therefore, an argument that demonstrates that those workers with high levels of exposure have higher rates of lung cancer than those with lower exposure would not apply to people who are not employed in the mill.",

Gilbert, the “Gilbert” in Gilbert and Sullivan, once said “The secret to my success is that I make people laugh and then I attack them with my cleverness.” The first part of his statement is widely accepted as a goal in entertainment and comedy, while the second part is an unexpected twist. But it’s the cleverness, the perceived incongruity, that delivers the punch. This is why a line like “My wife, Mary, has been getting on my nerves lately” works. At first glance you have a man who’s frustrated with his wife but nothing seems out of place.

The psychologists concluded that while we may feel happy or sad for extended periods of time, our feelings and moods typically fluctuate throughout the day. Thus, one remedy for those “down” moments is simply to remind ourselves that in time our feelings will change. We may not feel better immediately, but eventually we will feel better.

Behaviors like these can be seen as attempts by individuals or groups to maximize their reproductive success.

This means that there is no such thing as an objective reality: there is only an interactive reality. It also means that our minds interact with the physical universe to create our perception of reality. In other words, our minds play a central role in creating what we see and believe to be real. In this sense, then, we are not just passive observers of reality; we are active creators of it.

In fact, it is essential for happiness that we do not attach too much importance to what goes on within us.” The ability to find contentment, according to Hume, has less to do with internal factors than it does with our external circumstances.

In some cases, however, animals must drink in a more controlled manner. Honeybees, for example, often feed on liquid inside flowers. If bees simply drank as much as they could at one time they would soon become too heavy to fly and would be unable to return to their hive. To avoid this problem, bees have evolved a highly complex feeding behaviour that allows them to drink small amounts of nectar at a time from flowers. This is achieved by extending their proboscis (a straw-like structure) into the flower and then drawing up nectar through it. The quantity of liquid consumed can be carefully adjusted by the bee. Because bees frequently encounter many different plants with different types of flowers and different concentrations of nectar, the ability to vary the amount of liquid consumed is very important.",

The idea of how individuals use the social world as a stage is central to the work of Erving Goffman, a sociologist who sought to understand human interaction in terms of drama or theatrical performance. The term used by Goffman for this process of presenting ourselves to others is impression management. In his most famous book, The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life (1959), Goffman argues that people come equipped with a certain kind of “performance script” that tells us how to behave in various settings and how to play various roles. We learn these scripts as we grow up, and they become deeply ingrained habits that guide us as we go about our everyday lives. For example, the way you behave in a classroom is almost certainly different from the way you act at home.",

The paradoxical attraction of sad music has been studied and discussed in a number of scientific disciplines. A possible explanation is that the pleasure experienced when listening to sad music is not necessarily associated with the sadness of the music and may instead be related to an internal physiological response (or “chills”) occurring when the music is particularly moving. According to Gabrielsson’s (2002) model of strong experiences with music, listeners’ experience of such moments in music may be due to a combination of factors including: (i) a perceptual juxtaposition between contrasting musical sections; (ii) an emotional tension between different parts of a piece; (iii) an increase in emotional intensity; and (iv) a suspension of expectation regarding the direction or outcome of the music. These elements have been shown to give rise to pleasurable feelings, which are not necessarily related to the emotions expressed by the music.",

The concept of family is an important one in human society: we are all born into families and remain part of a family group throughout our lives. But the family group is not a fixed institution: it has undergone many changes over the course of human evolution. There are societies today, such as the !Kung people of southern Africa, in which there are no distinct families at all; instead, the entire band shares responsibilities for all children.

This dispersal is also a highly selected trait, and larvae have evolved many strategies to find suitable habitats, where they can settle. In some cases, they are attracted to chemical cues that are released by adult members of their own species; in others, they are attracted to suitable physical features of the habitat, such as potholes or crevices. The sensory systems and behavior of planktonic larvae thus provide an interesting perspective on the sensory world of marine organisms. There is evidence that some organisms use waterborne odorants to locate their prey and mates. This makes sense because waterborne chemicals move much faster than most marine animals and are not affected by currents in the same way that swimming individuals are. The benefit of chemical signaling has been demonstrated in experiments showing that crabs find their prey more quickly when they have access to chemical cues than when they must rely on visual or tactile information alone.",

The word “Stoic” comes from the Greek word stoa, which refers to the porch where Zeno, the founder of Stoicism, would meet and discuss his ideas with his students. They discussed such things as moderation and temperance, learning to endure pain, and how to deal with life’s difficulties without being overcome by them. The Stoic philosopher Epictetus said that “people are not disturbed by things but by the view they take of them.” In other words, it’s our perceptions about events that cause our emotional turmoil. If we change our perceptions, we can change our feelings. For example, if someone insults you but you don’t take it personally, it won’t bother you at all. But if you take it as a personal attack on your character or abilities, you’ll likely be angry and hurt. Therefore, it’s the perception that creates the emotion. By changing your perceptions about an event or situation, you can change your emotions too.",

In such cases, social psychologists have used the technique of laboratory research, in which people are brought into a controlled setting and their behavior can be observed. This method has both advantages and disadvantages. Its chief advantage is that it permits greater control than is possible in field research (research done in natural settings). Researchers can directly manipulate the factors they want to investigate and eliminate extraneous variables that might affect the findings. The disadvantage of laboratory research is that it may be low in external validity (the extent to which the results from one study can be applied to other situations).

They became interested in the study of nonconscious processes ― those mental activities that occur without our being aware of them. Their research showed that people often behave in nonconscious ways and out of nonconscious motives. For example, people are more likely to assert their individuality after being reminded of their own death. Typically, when we think of death, we think of things like loved ones who have passed on and the importance of religious faith. However, thinking about death also makes us more conscious of our present lives, and this increases our need to feel unique and different from others. When researchers pointed out the link between thoughts of mortality and the need for uniqueness, college students who had been reminded of their own deaths wrote essays expressing more unique opinions than did students who had been reminded of something less startling (such as having a tooth pulled). The essay writers were not necessarily aware that they were expressing their individuality because they had been thinking about death; thus the expression occurred at a nonconscious level.",

If an experimenter plays a loudspeaker recording of the call of an adult feeding call over a loudspeaker, the chick will respond by begging, even though there are no adults present to feed it. This shows that the chick does not learn to beg from its parent by imitating its parent’s vocalizations; rather, it learns to beg as a result of an inherited tendency to make certain sounds in response to certain situations.

But we make the mistake of thinking that if we forgive someone then it implies that what they did was not really wrong, or not as wrong as we had previously thought.

It is often referred to as the complex division of labor. In such societies, people are united by the roles they play, rather than by their shared values and interests. This is particularly true in modern industrial societies. The point to be made here is that if we are going to prevent social decay, it will be necessary to find ways to create social solidarity either through mechanical solidarity or through organic solidarity. The key, again, is finding a proper balance between these two modes of social integration. What this means in practical terms for modern industrial societies is that we must find ways to increase the moral ties that bind people together, while still assuring them some freedom from the oppressive forces of the collective conscience.",

Insecure employees may misuse computers or disregard security policy just to get their work done more quickly or easily. They generally don’t understand the risks or the consequences of their actions, even if they’re dangerous. They also don’t feel responsible for the security of their organization’s information and technology.

In these northern forests, severe fires occur every 50 to 200 years. The size and intensity of these fires are directly related to climate; during dry years, these ecosystems are more susceptible to fire. As a result of frequent fires, boreal trees have adapted to survive fire. For example, coniferous trees have thick bark that protects them from heat and flames. In addition, seeds are released from the tree's cones and quickly germinate in the ash-enriched soil left behind by a fire. In this way, fire creates space for new plants and animals to flourish in an ecosystem that would otherwise be choked with old growth. For this reason, it is believed that controlled burns may help reduce the frequency of severe fires by removing deadwood that can fuel intense wildfires.",

However, in most practical settings we can easily detect much smaller differences in weight. A person can perceive a difference between a 100 gram and a 110 gram weight because they are close in magnitude to each other. This fact creates an apparent contradiction between the continuous nature of physical magnitudes and our experience of them as discrete categories.

Rapid population growth also leads to a rise in the number of illegal immigrants moving from one country to another. At the same time, increasing population density within nations often results in greater cultural diversity and eventually a decrease in ethnocentrism. People who live close to others from different racial and cultural backgrounds are less likely to hold negative stereotypes about them than those who live in more homogenous areas. As a result, many researchers believe that as the world’s population continues to grow and become more diverse, global culture will be less ethnocentric and more accommodating of differences than ever before.",

Since men were more powerful than women, and since it was a principle of ancient science that small numbers could never produce large ones, the Pythagoreans deduced that male children had to be produced by assigning them even numbers, while female children had to be produced by assigning them odd numbers. Thus, for example, if one wanted to make a woman from a man, he could start with an even number like 2 and add an odd number like 3.

For example, worker ants are responsible for maintaining the nest as well as caring for the queen’s offspring. They must also find food for themselves and for other members of their colony. Because all of these tasks require different skills and energy considerations, it is likely that worker ants must be nutritionally flexible in order to carry out these responsibilities.

If you can get $1,000 worth of hairpins from this ton of steel and each hairpin sells for 10 cents, then roughly 90 percent of your costs must be accounted for by factors other than material.

Or the cost might be high because it takes an expert designer many months to figure out how to get 10,000 hairpins out of a ton of steel with minimum waste.

This argument for cultural relativism is based on the observation that when it comes to moral decisions, it is not always clear what the right thing to do is. A number of philosophers have used this fact as a basis for denying that there are any objective moral standards . For example, David Wong (2006) argues that “there is no rational way of determining which among [a range of conflicting] moral standards just happens to be binding on human beings” (p. 234, emphasis mine).

Although this logic is common and reasonable, it can also be very misleading and incomplete. The trouble arises from the assumption that our expectations are always accurate.

As a result, cultural evolution can have a major impact on our genes. A good example is the ability to digest lactose in milk after weaning. The gene for lactose digestion was selected for about 8,000 years ago among cattle farmers and spread rapidly. Today about 90 percent of Europeans can digest lactose; among African Americans it is only 60 percent and among Chinese less than 40 percent. This difference between populations in their ability to digest lactose is not due to genetic differences but to differences in historical exposure to milk consumption. This shows that culture can influence genetic variation, as long as there are enough people who share the same culture and live in relative isolation from other groups, so that they are not diluted by gene flow with other groups.",

In the United States, English has long been the official language and has been protected as such by a set of laws and judicial decisions. Speaking another language at school was discouraged and often punished, because it was associated with lower intelligence and inferiority.

For example, McDonald’s offers its standard menu in most locations around the world, but it also offers local items such as the Filet-O-Fish sandwich in Muslim countries (where eating meat from land animals is discouraged) and rice dishes in Asian countries.

But it’s also because the camera seems to give us a god’s-eye view, showing us things from a point of view that we’d never experience ourselves; and this affects how we interpret what we see, often without our even realizing it. For example, in the early days of photography there was one particular type of image that audiences found particularly hard to accept.

This process of breaking down sound into its component frequency parts is called a Fourier analysis. The process of analyzing sound for its frequency components is usually accomplished in the inner ear by the basilar membrane, which is a long strip of specialized tissue that runs along the length of the snail-shaped cochlea.

The compound also increases seed germination when applied to seeds inside the fruit and when excreted by animals that come into contact with it. This fact suggests that actaeine’s function in the fruit may be as a deterrent to larger animals.

In other words, if you privatize or nationalize the resource, you lose. The only solution is to democratize it. The people who use it have to be able to make decisions about how best to manage it.

Foragers returning from successful trips to nectar sources tend to repeat an individual behavior pattern that is different from that displayed by unsuccessful foragers as well as that displayed by bees who have no yet left the nest to seek food. The pattern begins when the bee lands at the entrance and extends her proboscis into the air, perhaps to get a sense of where she is relative to her goal. She then extends her tongue and waves it back and forth while fanning her wings rapidly. This may be intended to signal other foragers where she found food and how good it was. ―Bees use many signals to communicate with each other, so we suspect that one or more of these behaviors really do tell other bees about your experience,‖ said biologist James Nieh of San Diego University in California.",

However, once an innovation has been tailored to meet specific user needs, it may be difficult for other users with different requirements to adapt the technology to meet their needs.

For Whitman, the ultimate reward for poets who write their best work is not earthly renown . . . but an immortality of the spirit. This immortality is not reserved for the few, but for all poets who learn to write from the heart.

Multitasking can result in time lost due to task-switching.

The net result is that multitasking can slow us down by as much as 40%, and can also result in more errors than when we focus on one task at a time. In addition, if you are multitasking because you are trying to get more done in less time, it is important to consider the cost of errors.

The idea that one could model the growth of a population to determine whether it was in fact evolving had not been established as standard practice. In the 1920s, however, Ronald Fisher used mathematical models to show that even if natural selection made only a tiny difference in the survival or reproductive success between two competing varieties within a species (a situation that might well have arisen since natural selection is often weak), their frequencies would change over time. This was quite a revelation: it meant that one could not use population size alone as an indication of whether evolution had occurred. The conventional wisdom at the time was that evolution only occurred when populations were small, since only then would genetic drift be strong enough to overcome natural selection. Fisher’s models showed this not to be true.",

In a study where a sound source was moved around a blindfolded subject, Sparks and his colleagues discovered that people tend to anticipate the future location of an approaching sound source by turning their head and eyes in the direction from which they expect it to come. This idea demonstrates how our perceptual system uses sensory information in a way that would maximize our chances of survival.

That is because the tips of your fingers can exert only a small amount of force. But if you place the same object in your palm, and close your fingers around it, you will find that holding on to it is much easier.

A mother who cares for her babies (and those of other relatives) is more likely to ensure that these very closely related individuals survive and therefore pass on their genes (which contain many of the same alleles) as well.

However, the novel as we know it nowadays — a complex work of fiction in prose with a protagonist and a plot — can be traced back to the development of the printing press. This allowed books to be produced relatively quickly and cheaply, and for the first time authors could write what they pleased, knowing that they could reach a wider audience than just those who could afford an illuminated manuscript. Although the novel form has changed over time, many of its characteristics have remained constant. The fact that it is written in prose separates it from other forms like poetry or drama; although some novels do contain poetry or plays, they are predominantly written in prose. We might also say that novels are character-led: although not all novels have a character as their protagonist, all novels depict human experience in some way, and this is usually shown through a particular character’s eyes.",

The impact of your footfall is transferred straight to your legs as a jarring force, which can cause fatigue and injury.

However, there are drawbacks to running on soft surfaces too. They rob you of the energy that is returned to you when you run on hard surfaces. This effect is something like that experienced when walking on sand: it’s harder than walking on a hard surface because with each step you have to lift up not only the weight of your body but also the weight of the displaced sand.

The reason we tend to prefer titles for works of visual art has less to do with our laziness and lack of imagination, then, than with the fact that titles are bound up with the very nature of what we are looking at.

The emporia were colonies founded by the Greek speaking world in Egypt, Italy, North Africa, the Middle East and other places where Greeks settled. They had no walls and no city council. They were ruled by merchant princes. No matter how wealthy or powerful they became, however, they did not rule over their subjects with their own armies or make laws. The emporia were too small to be self-sufficient and had to trade with the local people who lived nearby. So the merchant princes had to be polite to them — even when they did not want to be. This was the first time in history that a community of people had been organized by the principle of exchange rather than by power or custom . It was an experiment that worked brilliantly but it was also dangerous because it made it hard for the merchants to defend themselves from enemies.",

Soderbergh used a more advanced digital camera for Ocean’s Twelve (2004), but also found ways to exploit its limitations; for example, he employed long takes and moving shots because digital cameras have trouble with exposure time and depth of field.

Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by trees, and when they are replaced by new trees the carbon remains stored. Trees also create habitat for wildlife and can reduce the risk of floods. However, wood has several disadvantages that make it less sustainable than might first appear. Firstly, it requires large amounts of water for its growth and processing.

Some of these plants also were more likely to be resistant to disease because their progenitors had been exposed to a variety of diseases for thousands of generations. Yet others had certain genetic mutations that made seed dispersal more difficult. These plants did not survive well in the wild, but they flourished when planted close together by humans. From the point of view of wild plant species, it was a good business to have humans as partners. They provided essential nutrients and water, and protected against pests and diseases. On the other hand, they also limited the species’ freedom to spread out on their own and reduced their genetic diversity over time.",

The result is that each farmer will try to maximize his or her own benefit by overusing the common resource, while neglecting his or her share of the costs. For example, a farmer who adds an extra animal to his herd may profit from its greater output at the expense of overgrazing. But if enough other farmers do likewise, it may lead to overgrazing and a net loss for everyone.

However, when we apply this piecemeal strategy to the big problems of our lives, it often fails us.

The most important issue in this context is how to realize that flexibility at the lowest possible cost. The solution depends on the extent to which the production process can be broken down into independent, self-sufficient modules. Since farmers cannot simply wait until they have solved their production problems before they start producing, it follows that each step in the chain must be organized as a separate manufacturing operation. This is especially important in view of the experience over the last few decades. In order to continue with mass production processes, it has often been necessary to reduce input costs by lowering wages, and increasing working hours. As a result, it has become increasingly difficult to find good quality staff for food processing businesses and keep them on board.",

But we don’t have to actually see someone to pick up on their foreign-ness and avoid them. People can often discern “foreign” faces from “non-foreign” ones.

However, if the other car is also playing music at the time, we may not be able to identify where it is coming from. The reason for this is that the auditory clues that we normally use are masked by those of a higher intensity. To test this theory, researchers had people listen to a series of tones while wearing headphones that simulated a three-dimensional sound space. When subjects were asked to point to the speaker from which they thought the sounds were emanating, they usually pointed in the right direction but were not very accurate about how far away it was. In other words, they could tell whether it was coming from their left or right side but had trouble telling if it was close or far away.",

This trait can cause problems for those who work with people from other cultures.

If someone believes in God and that all life is a result of divine creation, the scientific explanation of how species change over time through processes such as natural selection may be interpreted as being compatible with their religious beliefs. This has led some scholars to suggest that science and religion are not mutually exclusive but rather complementary in that they can both reveal different aspects of the human experience.",

The scientific method is a cyclical process that begins when the researcher asks an important question about the natural world. Using logic and previously discovered knowledge, a testable hypothesis is formulated, which is an educated guess about the answer to the question. In many cases, researchers use preliminary data from their own work as well as information from existing literature to develop their hypotheses. Working from this hypothesis, the scientist then designs an experiment or series of tests to collect data. This information helps to confirm or reject the hypothesis. If the results are consistent with the hypothesis, then other scientists must be able to repeat your experiments and get similar results for it to be accepted by other researchers in your field.",

In the Cell study, researchers led by Gerard Karsenty at Columbia University and Dana Levasseur at Harvard University extracted plasma from three-month-old mice (in human terms, roughly young adults) and injected it into 12-month-old mice (in human terms, middle-aged adults). The older mice showed signs of improved muscle function within just a few days. Then they injected the older mice with osteocalcin alone and saw a similar effect on muscle rebuilding. The researchers are now trying to figure out how osteocalcin works its magic on muscle. It’s possible that the hormone acts directly on stem cells in muscle tissue to make them more active, or it could be that osteocalcin triggers chemical signals that travel from bone to muscles.",

Such a view leads to a very interesting conclusion: if we were able to create a complete list of all the parts and principles underlying a certain phenomenon at one level (which we certainly cannot do with an economy), we could then predict the behavior of this phenomenon at the next higher level without considering its components. That is, as long as we know what a large number of neurons are doing, we don’t need to know what any individual neuron is doing in order to predict what a person’s brain will do next.

        "full_paragraph": "Creativity can be defined as the ability to generate ideas, products, or solutions that are both novel and appropriate. Psychologists agree that creativity is a product of both nature and nurture; it requires a certain inborn talent as well as the right environment to develop. It is also a product of one’s education, experiences, and training. For example, according to the sociocultural approach to creativity, creative thinking is influenced by social background and cultural practice. It is not simply an individual’s cognitive gift that leads to creative work; it is also the interpersonal relationships among people in a team or group that matter. At a more general level, this means that creative efforts are not just the result of individual action; they also depend on social interaction and cooperation among people with different skills and talents. The sociocultural approach also claims that creativity depends on particular contexts (or cultures) for its development. For instance, creativity in modern Western art often involves “breaking the rules,” whereas for some Eastern artistic traditions, such as haiku poetry or classical Chinese painting, creativity may be more about working within established conventions in new ways.",

Cognitive psychologists refer to these as ―cognitive illusions‖ because their effects can be as misleading as visual illusions. For example, if you were in a group of 100 people who were all very mediocre at shooting basketballs (and you were no exception), you would nonetheless look like a solid shooter for one night if your mother was the only person in the crowd cheering for you.

So although there are many different ways in which researchers might try to understand the human mind, one obvious starting place is by asking what all humans have in common.

This orientation has been critical in allowing Asian societies to benefit from agricultural innovation. As wheat was domesticated in western Eurasia, it spread relatively quickly across the continent — to India in the south and China in the east. The spread of rice from China to Japan followed a similar pattern. This contrasted with the Americas, where latitudinal constraints greatly slowed down the diffusion of crops from north-south overland axes, preventing maize and quinoa from reaching southern South America for many centuries. These geographic constraints are much less relevant today, but they have had profound implications for how different world regions have developed over time.",

As time went on and clock technology improved, clocks got smaller. And because they were so easy to read and set (the time was always right there in front of you), clocks became something of an obsession with the newly industrializing world. Workers had to be on the job at a particular time, machines had to be turned on and off at regular intervals, and products had to make their way through the production process according to a predetermined schedule. The clock was, as historian Lewis Mumford put it, “a means of control” that “made possible the idea of regular work.” No longer could people come and go as they pleased or work according to their own rhythm; now everything had to fit into the strictures imposed by hours and minutes.",

One possibility is that at least in some cases the mutation that has an effect on late life also has a deleterious effect earlier in life, and so is selected against by natural selection, but if the individual survives to the point where the deleterious effect is not longer relevant, it will be selected for. For example, imagine that there is a gene that causes increased growth rate but also causes decreased reproductive capacity. In young individuals, whose primary concern is growth and reproduction, this gene would be selected against by natural selection. However, once they had achieved full size and begun to reproduce, this gene would no longer have a selective disadvantage in young individuals and so could persist in populations . The fitness advantage of this gene would be more apparent in older individuals who have achieved full size and are not dead yet than in younger individuals who are growing and reproducing .",

For example, when Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin in 1793, he did not have a patent; as a result, other firms were able to copy his invention, which resulted in him being unable to capture fully the benefits of his R&D investment. This reduced his incentive to innovate. A second reason is that firms must invest significant amounts of resources in R&D before they know if their investments will pay off. For example, many drugs fail in testing and never make it to market. As a result, private firms may underinvest in R&D because they wish to avoid risk. A third reason is that some R&D has social benefits that go beyond those captured by the innovating firm and its customers.

This difference may have its roots in ancient musical traditions which have been passed down through many generations. The fact that the European singing voice tends to be more high-pitched may be related to the need to carry across an open expanse of water or through densely forested areas where sound waves can’t penetrate as deeply as they can in open spaces.

He suggested that, in the context of their own cultural values, ‘the concept of an institutionalized sharing group is dysfunctional because it violates the fundamental principles of autonomy and individualism which are valued predomniantly among the North American Eskimo.’ Anthropologists have generally approached this question from an evolutionary perspective, arguing that kinship institutions play a central role in determining social life, and that societal patterns cannot be understood without reference to local attitudes towards kinship.",

These activities required data collection and management, so it is not surprising that writing was developed to meet these needs. We have numerous examples of temple inventories etched in cuneiform script on clay tablets: lists of sheep and goats, beer and bread. In other words, one important reason writing was developed was to keep track of economic data in order to manage the complex transactions involved in running a temple, which was at once a place of worship and the equivalent of a modern-day corporation. The Sumerian temples show us that writing was developed to meet human needs: it did not emerge from some abstract aesthetic impulse or an urge to express oneself.

But birds designed for high-speed hunting or migration have short wings with relatively large surface areas. These wings are less efficient at slow speeds but can handle the heat generated at maximum velocity. A peregrine falcon, for example, has a wing aspect ratio of 5:1, compared to an albatross’s 13:1.

In the second case, he was told by people living near the project area that it would have a major impact; but when he arrived there, he found an environment in good condition and people who were well off. This story makes clear that what we see as impact depends greatly on our values, expectations, and background assumptions.",

In 1924 Nadezhda Mandelstam’s first book was published under the name Osip Mandelstam; only later in life did she write a memoir about her husband and her own life as his wife. Writing from the perspective of a man opens up possibilities that women have been denied and that women readers are denied. When women act as if they can adopt a masculine posture in order to be taken seriously, they are responding to a cultural problem with an individual solution. Yet it is also true that when women write under male pseudonyms, or publish articles without revealing that they are women, they are not just providing an example of how individuals can work around cultural barriers; they are also confirming that the only way for women to succeed is by camouflaging their gender.",

Humor activates the brain’s reward center, which sends dopamine to relieve stress and anxiety.

The implication of this is that in general you can be muscular or you can be fast, but you cannot be both at the same time.

Beitz identifies two principles that govern the distribution of social goods among individuals in a given state: first, people should have equal rights to the basic social goods they need to develop their capacities as human beings; and second, people should be rewarded according to their efforts and the value of their contribution to society. In a world divided into nation-states, however, these principles are not globally applied. The liberal states control most of the resources and keep them within their own borders rather than distributing them worldwide. This is in contradiction with their own philosophical basis and ethical principles. Even though liberal nationalists believe that their state has no moral obligation to non-citizens, they claim that the state should be governed by universal moral principles (that is, by impartial moral reasoning). The contradiction between the values of nationalism and the ethical principles of liberalism in contemporary international relations reflects a fundamental tension in political philosophy between partiality and impartiality.",

The same phenomenon can occur with products. It is often said that the best part about buying a new car is the day you buy it. You love the new smell, the clean interior, the great stereo system, and the way it handles on the highway. After driving it for a while, however, you get used to all these features and they no longer satisfy you in quite the same way.

When De Boer kicked to his right, Taffarel dove to his left, and saved the goal. Another strategy for a goalkeeper trying to save a penalty kick is to stay in the center of the goal as long as possible and react to which way the ball goes only after it is kicked. The idea behind this strategy is that it’s better for a goalkeeper to move horizontally (to his left or right) than vertically (up or down).

Then you simply light the candle and put it on top of the box. The point is that most people think about the tacks only in terms of holding something up, which is what they were designed for.

The authentic leader is comfortable being who he is, and he is not afraid to grant his employees the same freedom. He never asks himself, “What should I do?” Instead, he asks, “What would an authentic person do?” Being authentic means there is no difference between what you say and what you do. It also means not pretending to be something other than who you really are. As the boss, if you feel like telling a joke, tell it. If you think something tastes bad, say so. If you are happy or sad or mad or confused or anxious, show it. Letting your employees know who you really are can work wonders in creating a positive working environment.",

Man could not break free from this cycle of life and death. In this way, time was perceived not as an irreversible flow from one moment to the next but as an endless cycle in which things repeated themselves. In this view, time was not an evolution but a renewal, over and over again. The renewal of life was symbolized by the Greek goddess Persephone, who disappeared into the earth at harvesttime and reemerged in springtime as the bringer of new life and fertility.

Because each block can be used many times, it is possible to print many copies of a text quickly and easily.

Other temptations such as eating chocolate vs. avoiding it did not show the same pattern — that is, cleansing their hands with hand wipes after choosing not to eat chocolate did nothing to alleviate the guilt they felt for resisting temptation. This suggests that cleansing oneself can alleviate guilt only when physical (as opposed to mental) impurity has been incurred through a moral deed . Even more interestingly, when participants were asked to predict whether using a hand wipe would alleviate their guilt, they denied that it would do so. Why? Because they were not aware of feeling guilty in the first place. In other words, people’s feelings of guilt are often unconscious and are therefore hard for them to recognize and admit .",

However, there is also a body of literature that points out the negative consequences of tourism on a destination and its inhabitants. It has been shown that tourism has the potential to erode local cultures by transforming them into commodities. A culture can be reduced to its most interesting and easily commodified elements in an attempt to satisfy tourists’ expectations . The result can be an artificial reproduction of reality without any depth or authenticity. In addition, tourists often visit destinations that are poorer than their own. The inevitable encounters between travelers and the local population can lead to feelings of guilt among tourists, who may respond with overgenerous giving, which creates dependency. Although this may seem like a generous and well-meaning response, it can have negative long-term consequences , such as devaluation of local labor and erosion of traditional ways of life.",

If the pitcher throws a perfect strike, the catcher must catch it and throw it to second base in time to get the opposing player out. The second baseman must be in position to receive the ball in order to tag the runner out. If any part of this process fails, then the opposing team gets a base. Each player has a specific role to play when on defense. The batter and the base runners also have specific roles and responsibilities. When at bat, each player is trying to hit safely. This means that they are trying to hit a ball through an opening where there are no fielders or hit it so hard that they cannot throw it to first base before the batter gets there. A home run is also a good outcome, but it does not happen very often. Rounders has some of these attributes, but with smaller teams playing on a smaller pitch, meaning that there is less space for players to run into without being tagged out.",

The person who says she is “spiritual” tends to think of this as an expression of her free spirit, but it is also an expression of her upbringing. There was no choice not to be spiritual when she was young because she didn’t know there was such a thing as being spiritual . Her choice was made possible by her ignorance .",

Although tourism may help to preserve or revitalize some aspects of indigenous culture by providing an economic incentive to do so, at the same time it can be detrimental to cultural practices and beliefs by commercializing sacred or significant traditions for profit.

Throughout the book Huck has many adventures with his friend Jim, who is an escaped slave. The two are constantly on the run from people who would return Jim to his owner. In one scene they are floating down the Mississippi River past a community on its way to New Orleans. There are some men on the shore and Huck becomes afraid because if they learn that Jim is an escaped slave they will surely capture him and return him to his owner. So, Huck writes a letter to Miss Watson, Jim’s owner, telling her where she can find him. But then he considers how nice Jim has been to him and decides not to send the letter after all. He says: “I took it up and held it in my hand. I was a-trembling, because I’d got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and I knowed it. I studied a minute sort of holding my breath.” What he has decided between is whether he will turn Jim in or whether he will help him get away; in other words, between being good or being bad. He decides that he doesn’t want anything bad to happen to Jim so he tears up the letter and says “All right then, I’ll GO to hell.” Mark Twain pretends that Huck does not know what is right or wrong―he pretends that Huck thinks it is wrong not to return an escaped slave―but we know that Huck knows better than that. We see through Twain’s pretended ignorance in a way that Huck himself cannot; we see that Huck really does know what is right and wrong but goes against his conscience because it would be so much easier for him if he did what he wanted instead of what was right. Twain knows how difficult it can be for people when they go against their consciences; he knows how much courage it takes for someone like Huck to do what he did, so he tells us through Huck’s own voice how much courage it took for him not to do what was wrong. This use of irony makes this passage memorable and meaningful rather than just amusing or exciting as it might otherwise have been .",

For this reason, although Cajun music and food are now celebrated worldwide as authentic expressions of a distinctive regional culture, in the past many Cajuns viewed these same traditions with embarrassment. Similarly, though Creole cuisine has long been cherished by sophisticated foodies around the globe as an international treasure, for years many Creole cooks were ashamed to admit that they made their living preparing it.

Some people trust their fellow humans to a greater extent than they trust their governments or laws. For others it’s the other way around.

Like a cat chasing its own tail, economists cannot stand outside the economic system and examine it objectively. Inflation may be caused by too much money in circulation, but rising prices also lead to increased demand for labor and therefore higher wages. This means that there is no way to conduct a controlled experiment to figure out what really causes inflation. Economists have tried their hand at running large­scale experiments by creating models of economies on computers and then trying out various policies to see what happens — but the results are often inconclusive because every model makes assumptions about how people will behave in response to new policies, and these assumptions may turn out to be wrong.",

Science is a complex process and scientists don’t know everything. But what many people fail to realize is that science is both self-correcting and cumulative. As new evidence comes in, scientific ideas get refined and sometimes overturned. The beauty of science is that it has a built-in error correction mechanism so that over time it gets closer and closer to the truth. There will always be some uncertainty about any scientific claim, but there’s no question that on balance, modern science has produced an enormous amount of reliable knowledge about how the world works.",

Then one group was told that their answers would be checked later on, while another group was told that they could look up the answers if they wanted to. When researchers asked them how well they thought they did, those who were allowed to look up the answers rated their performance as better than those who were told their answers would be checked.

Sustainability boundaries address such issues as global warming, biodiversity loss, and ocean acidification — all caused by human activity. The most important thing about these boundaries is that they are all interconnected. Pushing one over its threshold makes it more likely that others will also be exceeded. One example: if we continue our high emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, it is likely that we will push climate change so far that many other sustainability boundaries will be crossed as well.",

The best way to do this is often through analogy or comparison, which is exactly what a metaphor provides.

While the topic of freedom is an important consideration in parenting, it’s interesting that few people stop to consider the complex interchange between parents’ historical experiences and children’s current level of freedom. The type and amount of freedom one parent provides to a child may be determined by that parent’s own experiences as a child. If our parents were overly permissive, we might become anxious about providing our children with too much autonomy. If our parents were overly controlling, we might feel guilty for not providing our own children with enough freedom. Our historical experience may also lead us to provide our children with more or less freedom than we believe they should have or need. In this way, our own history may influence how we parent our children.",

Bloch’s approach to rural history involved an analysis of individual villages and their social structures, and his work led him to emphasize the political and social importance of these small units. Each village had its own council, its own assembly, and its own laws; each one was a community with its own identity. In his book The Historian’s Craft, Bloch wrote about history as an art: “The historian is, essentially, less interested in history than the other humanists are in their respective fields.

This means that the judge must interpret the existing rules and principles — whether or not they are explicitly stated — so that the parties who appear before him have some idea of what their rights and duties will be going forward. And because it is usually not enough simply to state conclusions (for example, “The judgment is reversed”), judges must also reason through their decisions, which typically requires them to discuss and reject counterarguments along the way.

The disposable income of young, educated consumers in China and India is rising quickly, and they are choosing to spend that money on material goods rather than save it for a rainy day. At the same time, consumers in the West are becoming more aware of the environmental impact — as well as the financial cost — of their purchasing decisions and are starting to rethink what they buy and why. These factors will have a major influence on global markets. By understanding these changing patterns of consumer spending and behavior, companies can better target their products at specific customer segments or develop new goods altogether. For example, a Canadian company has developed eco-friendly diapers that break down faster when discarded in landfills — a response to growing demand for environmentally sensitive products from concerned parents around the world.",

But sometimes our script is unhelpful. For example, you may know someone who has multiple operations within a short space of time, and you may find it difficult to believe that they are still in pain after each one. Your script includes the idea that operations get rid of pain, so you interpret any further reports of pain as evidence that your friend must be malingering or exaggerating how bad things really are. Or perhaps you know someone who looks well but says they are in terrible pain, and you find it hard to believe them because your script says that people in pain look ill or distressed . This makes it difficult for people with chronic conditions to be believed when they say they are in pain.",

The geology of our planet is marked by five great mass extinctions when more than 75 percent of all species were rapidly wiped out. These extinctions were all caused by short, violent events such as volcanic eruptions or meteorite impacts. But one thing we have learned from studying these events is that while they were devastating in the short term, they opened up new environmental niches for younger, more vigorous species to fill.

A new science is now emerging that emphasizes this point. This new approach — called “extended heredity” — recognizes that genes can interact with other genes, with environmental factors, and also with other products of their expression, in ways that can change how the organism develops and functions. And some of these changes can be passed down to future generations. As a result, traits are inherited, but in ways that go beyond what was written in the DNA code at conception.

But Aristotle also thought that you could tell what something was by looking at what it does. When we look at the parts of a watch, for example, we can see that they are all designed to operate together so as to enable the watch to perform its function. A similar point applies to sensory systems, and here Aristotle’s account can be developed in a way that has been influential at least up until recent times. The purpose of sensory systems such as sight and hearing is to produce representations of the world around us; more specifically, their purpose is ‘veridical’ representation: they are supposed to show us how things really are. That is why we depend on them: if our vision were systematically wrong in representing size or shape or movement, then it wouldn’t be any help in guiding our actions. And we all know from experience that our senses can be quite fallible.

The process continues until one group or the other becomes dominant. In some areas, fires set by humans have played a significant role in maintaining savannas.

Many of the plants that we eat live within very specific temperature ranges and need a certain amount of water to grow properly.

Even if there is enough food grown in one area of the world, it may be difficult to move it to other areas that are experiencing food shortages if transportation systems are disrupted by extreme weather events.",

This is because in a more developed country kids are not needed to help with farming and other work and because women have greater opportunities to do other things with their lives than have children. In contrast, in less developed countries children are often seen as a form of wealth — they can work on the farm and take care of their parents when they get old.

The name \"sauerkraut\" is German and means \"sour cabbage,\" a reference to its distinctive sour flavor that results from fermentation. By the 1800s, it was known that sauerkraut prevented scurvy because it was a good source of vitamin C.

In other cases, the pressures arise more indirectly, from competitive demands made on workers within a given country by foreign workers in other parts of the world who are willing to work for lower wages. In either case, the result is that people are working longer and harder than ever before. For example, a recent study of a representative sample of full-time employed Americans showed that they worked 9 weeks more per year than their counterparts did in Europe.

Insects also require less water than conventional meat sources because they can absorb water from their food, and they contain less indigestible protein. When we raise insects using organic waste from our own food production or kitchen waste, we do not need to transport them over long distances.

Shopping as theater is the concept in which retailers recognize that shopping is entertainment and they are continually in competition with one another to make their store the best entertainment option. They design stores to be visually engaging, fun, and interesting so that the shopper will seek them out and then linger. Retailers stage events and demonstrations to pull people into the store or to keep them there. For example, cooking demonstrations can occur in grocery stores, which provide shoppers with a recipe for a meal and the ingredients right there in the store. A bookstore might have an author do a book signing; a clothing shop may have a fashion show; or even a pet store might have an animal trainer give a demonstration on how to teach your pet new tricks. All of these attractions keep people in the retail space longer, giving them more time to shop and spend money.",

Canned goods made life on the frontier more bearable and helped establish the practice of eating preserved foods throughout the year.

Elton’s basic idea was that species diversity is what stands between the invading species and a new place. It is the diversity of the local species that makes it difficult for a new one to get established. This is what might be called the biodiversity-invasibility hypothesis, and it has become a cornerstone of contemporary conservation biology. For example, if you want to keep an invader out of a place, you need to increase its native biodiversity. We can see this idea at work in our everyday experience: for instance, consider how much easier it is to weed a flower bed than an overgrown field. The more different kinds of flowers there are, the harder it is for any one kind of weed to become dominant.",

However, in practice this type of restoration is not as simple as it might first appear because although the birds can be returned to their former range, the conditions that promoted their initial decline may still exist. In some cases, features of the current environment may prevent translocated birds from surviving and breeding successfully. For example, if predator control has not been carried out effectively or often enough, mammalian predators will continue to have an impact on bird populations by reducing numbers of both adult and juvenile birds.",

Second, there is often a significant pool of underutilized cultural resources in a city that can act as attractions for tourists.

In Greek thought, as in that of other peoples, religion and myth had been for centuries the chief means by which men tried to explain the world and their own existence in it. The Greeks excelled in both these fields. They were imaginative, and their art and literature have commanded admiration down to our own day. They were also intellectual, and it is not surprising that they should have attempted to understand the world through reason as well as through emotion. The final decline of all the old city-states and their loss of effective independence was still a long way off when philosophy began to flourish around 600 BC. It is not too much to say that without the unifying influence of religious belief, Greek society would probably have disintegrated entirely under its internal divisions.",

Two of the workers had been killed on the job because they were not allowed to take shelter from the rain or snow. After they had stayed out for a few days, city officials obtained an injunction against the union. The union vote to continue the strike despite the injunction was unanimous. When Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. heard about this injustice, he flew to Memphis to join forces with these workers and their union. On April 3, 1968, King addressed a crowd of striking workers and supporters at Mason Temple Church of God in Christ in Memphis. His speech drew attention to the plight of these forgotten workers and their links to all working people everywhere who suffered economic hardship, racial discrimination, and threats to their very livelihoods.",

They develop a greater sense of self-confidence. They also learn that there are many ways to express oneself and that there really are no \"right\" or \"wrong\" ways to make art. They become more creative in other areas of their lives as well.",

In his work with motion, he asked questions about how fast objects fell and how long it took them to stop moving. He studied all sorts of objects, from feathers to cannonballs. His experiments led him to some important ideas about motion. Galileo discovered that if an object is moving along a smooth path, such as a barrel rolling down a hill, the object will keep moving forever if nothing stops it. This idea is called inertia. Another of his discoveries was that, unless something slows it down, an object will move at the same speed forever. This idea became known as the law of inertia. Galileo also discovered that objects fall at the same rate of speed no matter how heavy they are.",

However, in contemporary museum practice, curators are working increasingly with non-specialist staff, such as museum educators and designers, whose input is invaluable in ensuring that stories are told effectively and accessibly. In addition, most museums now invite feedback from visitors on new exhibitions. Instead of having walls covered with texts as people enter an exhibition, it is now common practice for museums to have a ‘soft opening’ period during which members of the public are invited to view an exhibition and provide feedback on their experience of it.

In particular, we add nitrates to farmland in the form of nitrates in fertiliser, and as manure from livestock.

They used an experimental method, in which six people were put into a room and shown two cards: one card had one line on it, and the other had three lines. Each person was asked to say which of the three lines was as long as the single line. Five of these participants were members of the research team and had already agreed to give the wrong answer in advance. The researchers wanted to find out how many times a naive participant would accept this wrong answer in order to conform with the majority view. The results showed that two-thirds of naive participants (67 per cent) accepted the wrong answer at least once and around a third (32 per cent) accepted it on more than half of the trials. This is striking evidence that individuals are willing to change their own views or actions as a result of being exposed to majority influence.",

Some chemicals in a plant’s tissues have a bitter taste that discourages many herbivores from eating the plant. Other chemicals are poisonous to some animals.

For example, song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) have larger spleens than do house sparrows (Passer domesticus), but this does not mean that house sparrows are maladapted because they have smaller spleens. Instead, house sparrows are simply smaller birds and so it is reasonable to expect them to have smaller spleens. A comparison between two species is only informative when potential confounding variables are controlled for. In this case, body size is a confounding variable because it is related to both species and spleen size.",

The lesson that working hard and saving money could bring success had been around for centuries, but only during the Industrial Revolution did this idea begin to gain a strong foothold. Until then, most people lived under conditions where time was dictated by their environment; but now they began to control their own time — investing it into work instead of leisure.",

As children grow, they become capable of a wider range of emotional responses. This is the basis for forming social relationships. Children learn that certain emotions are acceptable and that others are not. They learn to recognize emotions in others and eventually develop self-regulation skills that allow them to express their feelings in appropriate ways. Emotional development is an ongoing process from birth until death, but the foundations for adult emotional stability are laid in the first few years of life.",

Bird feeding is generally considered to be beneficial for the birds that are fed and is related to increased survival rates, increased reproductive rates, and increased population sizes. However, birds can also be harmed by human activities around bird feeding stations. For instance, birds can be injured or killed by outdoor cats that come to the area around bird feeders for the easy prey that is available there. Birds can also be attracted to busy streets or roads that they might not otherwise visit in search of food provided by humans. In addition, gathering under a feeder can increase the likelihood of disease transmission among birds.

This is because self-disclosure is one way people can reduce their own uncertainty about others and, in turn, increase their predictability. The process of getting to know someone better typically involves an exchange of personal information that is gradually more intimate. For example, on a first date you might ask someone about his or her job, where he or she lives, and interests and hobbies. You are not likely to ask about past relationships or how much money the person earns. Over time as the relationship develops and both people gain trust, they will be more willing to share deeper feelings and experiences because self-disclosure can lead to greater intimacy.",

This can help the other person get their thoughts and feelings off their chest, but it’s not enough to make them feel understood. To understand someone emotionally, you must notice not just what they are saying but also how they are saying it. Sometimes emotional cues are obvious: someone who raises her voice is probably showing anger; someone who relaxes his shoulders might be showing relief. However, often people express their feelings in subtle ways that others can easily miss. If you want to understand someone better by paying attention to their emotional cues, the first step is to know how they tend to express themselves when they are feeling different emotions.",

The foot should not change its natural function in order to accommodate a shoe’s design. When the fit of a shoe is poor, it can impact foot function and increase the risk of injury. For example, a study by Stacoff et al. found that shoes with too much heel lift alter the function of the calf muscles and reduce push-off power during walking. This is important because calf muscle weakness and poor push-off are factors that have been linked to an increased risk of falls in older adults. Likewise, poorly fitting shoes can also create blisters and other skin irritations that force people to stop their activity early or avoid exercise altogether. Therefore, proper fit affects both performance improvements and injury prevention for athletes at all levels.",

The result is that young people from lower-income backgrounds face a double disadvantage. Not only do they have fewer financial resources to rely on while they hold an unpaid internship, but they’re also less likely to have parents who can help them network their way into the kind of internship that can lead to a paid job. As a result, they leave school with fewer job opportunities and more debt than their wealthier peers.

Variable costs are those that increase or decrease with production. In contrast to fixed costs, variable costs can vary per unit produced. For example, a sculptor has to pay for the clay and tools used in the creation of each sculpture. If she crafts more sculptures, she will have to pay more for materials and tools; if she makes fewer sculptures, she will have fewer expenses. The high fixed cost of art production and low variable cost gives rise to another characteristic of the art industry: a few “superstars” earn outsized rewards, while most artists fail to break even on their production costs.",

This system is essential for survival — without it we would not act effectively to protect ourselves from danger.

Although users may not want to hear it, in almost all of these cases it was found that drivers had been applying the accelerator when they believed that they were applying the brake.

The reality is that career paths are not linear, family needs change over time, and marriage, divorce, childbearing, and mortality are realities that affect every individual. Therefore, strategies to accommodate family responsibilities are often important, particularly for women. These strategies may include flexible work schedules, telecommuting, part-time employment arrangements, job sharing, or full-time work from home. Some individuals take leaves of absence from a job to raise children or care for aging parents. Other individuals may start their own business to have more control over their work schedules and place of employment.",

Customers expect a certain amount of comfort and good service with their meals, and restaurateurs strive for an ambiance or style that will please their patrons. In addition, restaurants have to cater to a wide variety of tastes in food, which makes it difficult for them to develop any kind of specialty — at least on a long-term basis.

Social scientists help us understand how people’s values and attitudes toward the natural world shape their behavior in areas such as population control, energy consumption, and land use.

When they are told that they have done something wrong, they are usually not interested in why they did it or how the “wrong” action might be improved. They are interested in defending themselves and being “righted.” Although criticism may have a temporary effect on behavior, it does not result in learning over the longer term. When we criticize others, we usually set up a resistance and defensiveness that block our ability to provide helpful feedback.",

This type of thinking is called analogical thinking because you are finding an analogy between the problem you are currently facing and some previous problem. According to cognitive scientists, finding a good analogy can often lead to successful problem-solving because analogical thinking allows us to bring over many of our previous ideas from dealing with similar situations in the past.",

For example, they were more likely to remember a time when someone made fun of them in public and less likely to remember the time when someone spoke up for them. The lonely students said that they would have preferred not having been spoken up for; it was better not to have had the help at all than for help to be offered but then taken away.

We also learn from the consequences of our own actions. If we are rewarded for something, we are more likely to repeat it; if we are punished, we will probably not repeat the action.

In 1972, American paleontologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould suggested that a species’ morphology (size, shape, and other features) remains stable for long periods, with little or no morphological changes. This stability is called stasis. Then the species experiences a period in which rapid change occurs as new morphological characteristics arise. This rapid change is called punctuated equilibrium.

Lifelong learning refers to the process of developing and updating knowledge and skills throughout one’s life, beginning at birth and continuing through old age. In this view, education is not limited to formal schooling but includes all types of learning — from informal education in the home to vocational training on the job to formal instruction in a school or college. Although lifelong learning is a new term, its essence is as old as humankind itself. Throughout history, people have continued to learn long after they left school. The difference now is that knowledge changes more rapidly than ever before, so that people must update their skills more frequently if they are to remain productive workers or informed citizens.",

The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment has made it clear that many ecosystem services are being degraded by human activities; indeed, 15 of the 24 ecosystem services studied have been degraded over the past 50 years. The value of these services is not reflected in current markets; for example, forests are often more valuable when cleared than when standing. Market incentives (such as payments for ecosystem services) that encourage sustainable management could reward poor communities who maintain forests or restore land rather than degrade them.",

In recent years, however, some have argued that standardized testing could be beneficial if used in the right way. It can help teachers and students understand what they need to work on and it can provide a basis for comparison between schools. Teachers use tests to gauge how much students have learned in order to adjust their teaching accordingly. But the same tests can also be used by policymakers to hold teachers accountable for student performance, which puts pressure on teachers to focus on test preparation rather than helping students learn more deeply. The problem of using tests in this way has become more severe with the advent of high-stakes standardized tests, which have significant consequences for school funding, grade promotion, and teacher evaluation.",

Compound eyes consist of many individual units called ommatidia that each contain a lens and some light-sensitive cells. The many ommatidia that make up a compound eye work together to provide a mosaic of images that allow the ant to sense movement in all directions at once. Simple eyes are less developed than compound eyes and can detect only changes in light intensity rather than form images.

It is also important to recognize that the new competition in trade in goods and services has been accompanied by increased competition for jobs, particularly among low-skilled workers. This is not just a matter of people in developing countries competing with people in developed countries; it is also a matter of young people competing with old people, men competing with women, skilled workers competing with unskilled workers, and so on.",

The snake, accidentally introduced to the island in the late 1940s, has become so abundant that it is one of the most successful invasive species on the planet. On Guam, the brown tree snake has caused drastic declines in bird populations. In one study, researchers found that bird populations have declined from 13-14 per hectare in 1982 to just 1-2 birds per hectare in 2012. And these aren’t just any birds; they are some of the most unique and beautiful birds on Earth. In fact, nine of Guam’s twelve native forest bird species are now extinct due to predation by brown tree snakes. What’s even worse is that it is likely that most of these birds will never return to Guam because of the snake’s dominance and their ability to climb high into trees where the birds nest.",

It is abstract, without words, and this has led to a perceived lack of meaning by comparison with vocal music in which words are so important. But instrumental music does not need words; in many respects, it is more profound than vocal music because it can convey meanings that are beyond words and even beyond human experience.

However, not all scholars go along with this view, arguing that bird song is not music because it lacks the complex social context of human music making. Furthermore, while many birds repeat their songs over and over again with little variation between renditions, there are many examples of songbirds that vary their performances in a way that is strikingly similar to the improvisations made by jazz musicians.",

In exchange for causing such diseases, however, domesticated animals provided humans with a regular source of food that was not dependent on the season or the success of hunting.

Methylmercury can be accumulated by predators eating prey that are already contaminated with it. It becomes concentrated as it moves up the food chain by as much as a million times.

For example, sales of organic food in the United States increased at an average of 20 per cent per year between 1999 and 2006. Likewise, sales of organic food in Europe grew by 20-25 per cent annually between 1999 and 2006 . This growth has led to an increase in the global production and trade of organic products.",

Although this is not true for all media organizations, it is important to remember that the media may not provide an accurate view of a situation, but as a part of crisis communication, it is important to acknowledge and use the media constructively.

On the other hand, having a territory usually means that an animal has to work less hard to find food or mates. So the costs of a territory may be outweighed by its benefits. In fact, biologists think that territories have evolved because they give individuals a way to improve their chances of surviving and reproducing — exactly what natural selection would favor.

Although all five senses are processed through the brain, information from the olfactory nerve, which is responsible for transmitting odor information to the brain, is directly connected to the amygdala and hippocampus — both key components of the limbic system. While other sensory data first passes through the thalamus — a sort of gateway that decides where information should go in the brain — before continuing on to the amygdala or hippocampus, olfactory neurons bypass this gateway completely. This means that our sense of smell can trigger experiences, memories and emotions even before any rational thought has occurred.

So why do we eat so much sugar? One reason is that it makes foods taste better (a fact the industry exploits). Another factor is the steady fall in the price of sugar over the past century. In England, for example, one kilogram of sugar cost about two weeks’ wages for the average worker in 1757; by 1857 this had fallen to just a few hours’ wages and by 1957 to less than half an hour’s wages.",

She wasn’t particularly keen on running; she was just doing it to prove a point. However, when she was physically assaulted for her trouble, she decided that she had to do something about it. She contacted her university’s lawyer and told him what had happened. The lawyer demanded to know how women could be excluded from a public event, which was being run on public roads. He took the case to court and won it. The court ruled that it was illegal to stop women from participating in a race that had previously been open only to men. Thus, the Boston Marathon became the first major marathon in history to allow women to participate, although they were still not officially recognized until 1972.",

This idea is one example of a family of ideas that I’m very fond of, which I call “knowledge engineering” (or sometimes “cognitively inspired engineering”).

This unique dispersal mechanism requires a high degree of coordination between the time of year at which the fruit is ripe and the time of year when there is maximum demand for food by animals who might eat the seeds. This in turn requires animals to be able to track both time of year and season, and that would be difficult for them if they were in a constantly changing environment. The durian tree’s solution to this problem is simple: it has evolved to grow near rivers that have little seasonal variation in water levels, so that the timing of fruit ripening always matches the peak season for food demand in animals living along the riverbanks.",

In a study published in 2017, researchers in South Africa identified new genetic variants associated with skin color. One of the genes they identified, MFSD12, also contributes to eye and hair color. The same gene is associated with lighter skin color in people of East Asian and European descent. This suggests that rather than evolving independently, the same genes can be used to adapt to similar environments by different populations. In Europeans, this gene has undergone strong selection in the past 30,000 years; interestingly, it is even more strongly selected in Africans. This means that while both Europeans and Africans have lighter skin as a result of selection on these genes, the African case is even more extreme than what would be expected given the intensity of sunlight at their latitude. In other words, to get dark skin again after living in northern Europe for thousands of years hasn’t been easy for black immigrants from Africa.",

Instead of just keeping plants and animals as they were found in nature, people began to actively breed them to get certain characteristics that fit their needs. For example, wild cereal plants were similar to modern wheat and barley, but they had a few important differences. The seed heads broke apart easily when they were ripe, so they dropped their seeds on the ground and it was hard to harvest them. They also didn’t ripen all at once, so people had to go collect the seeds several times. People began to select for plants that had nonshattering seed heads and that ripened all at once. Over time these traits became more common in the population of plants and eventually these crops were domesticated: they became dependent on people for their survival.",

These “traps” are created by the same forces that cause folds and faults, so that oil and gas fields are often found in association with them. The migration of oil and gas is influenced primarily by the porosity of the source rock (the percentage of its volume that is open space) and its permeability (the ability of fluids to move through it). A highly porous rock like sandstone will allow oil to flow easily through it, while a rock like shale, which has little porosity, will hold on to its petroleum. A bed of limestone may be highly porous, but if it has been compacted under pressure from above and turned into a solid mass, it can still block the flow of oil.",

The idea was simple: photography could never be considered art if it only reproduced reality. Photographers wanted to show that their work was as beautiful and as detailed as any painting or sculpture. They manipulated the camera and the subject matter in order to make their pictures more artistic. It was a radical idea in its day, and it is one that continues to have an impact on how we view photographs.",

The answer is simple — machines. The Industrial Revolution began in England because European inventors and entrepreneurs developed new machines that greatly increased productivity. In 1793, Eli Whitney, an American engineer, invented a machine called the cotton gin that significantly reduced the cost of producing cotton (see image below). Prior to Whitney’s invention, separating cotton from its seeds was a laborious and time-consuming task. As a result, few people grew or processed cotton. Whitney’s invention made it possible to produce cotton at one-tenth of the previous cost. This led to a tremendous increase in demand for raw cotton and created an opportunity for European entrepreneurs who developed and financed new ways to produce textiles more efficiently.",

This approach is called the “hot sauce paradigm.” It’s based on a simple principle: If people are motivated to connect, they should avoid doing things that would lead others to reject them. For example, if you’re about to go on a first date with someone you’ve had your eye on for months, you’re probably not going to tell her or him that they should lay off the fried foods because they’ve been looking a bit paunchy lately. On the other hand, if you don’t care about being rejected by someone, or if you’ve given up on connecting with them altogether, then all bets are off. In that case, you might say anything and everything that comes to mind ― including comments about their weight! In the hot sauce paradigm, participants believe they are playing a computer game with other participants online. Unknown to them, there are no other participants. The computer program is set so that it randomly selects some of the participants and ignores them. They think this is happening by accident or due to technical difficulties outside their control. When they get done playing the game (which involves setting up a plate of hot sauce for another participant who has indicated a preference for mild foods), they have an opportunity to rate how much of each condiment should be included in the next round of the game. People who have been excluded tend to pour more hot sauce onto the plate ― in fact, they pour about twice as much as people who have been included! These results show that social exclusion can lead people to act aggressively toward others in ways that could potentially lead those others to avoid interacting with them in the future; in other words, it leads them not only away from connection but also toward rejection.",

At this point in its life cycle, its notochord also starts to disappear and its brain becomes rudimentary. It also loses its digestive system and stops swimming around; instead it filters water through its body to extract food particles.

No one is watching what you do while you’re out and about; your privacy is assured by the fact that it’s dark out there. In a zoo, nobody is watching either — so long as the zoo has been designed with privacy in mind. The animal must be able to go out into his exhibit, where no one can see him, and forage for food without having to put on a show for anyone who might be watching.

This discovery has enormous implications for our understanding of how the brain works and for our understanding of how we can help people learn and recover from injuries.

The second stage is a period of mass production in which children are seen as products to be standardized and graded.

The bark contains medicinal compounds used against malaria, and in 2004, the U.S. National Academy of Science reported that neem was one of two species – from 3,900 studied – most likely to be useful in human health care and food production.",

The complexity comes from the network of neurons, each of which does something very simple: it takes in an input and produces an output. An artificial neural network (ANN) is a program (or model) that does something similar. It’s a set of artificial neurons that are connected to one another, with each connection having a number associated with it. That number is called the weight of the connection. It determines how much the output of one neuron is amplified or dimin-ished as an input for another neuron. To train the ANN to perform some task—like telling whether an image contains a cat or not—the weights on the connections are adjusted automatically so that the ANN’s output becomes more accurate over time. The larger question is how well this works. For a long time, ANNs weren’t nearly as useful as other methods for tasks like speech recognition and image classification . But in recent years, deep learning has changed all that.",

It is a view that sees humans as separate from nature, sets them over and against it, and puts them in charge. To live up to this role, humans developed science as a means of controlling nature — for their own benefit, or so they thought. This was an attempt not just to understand nature but to dominate it.

For example, group members who are initially inclined to make a particular decision often adopt an even more extreme view in the direction of their initial inclination after discussing the issue with other group members. In one particularly well-known study, James Stoner (1961) asked groups of managers to estimate the probabilities of the success or failure of proposed projects. The researchers found that individuals who were leaning toward a risky decision before discussion became even more risky after consulting with others in the group. These findings have important implications for group decision-making: more extreme decisions are generally less accurate than moderate decisions because they ignore information that is inconsistent with the direction of the already dominant opinion.",

So long as your readership or listenership was growing, you could support a larger staff and provide even better content.

So, for example, the statement “all swans are white” is scientific because one could test it by looking for swans of other colors. In contrast, the statement “there is a teapot orbiting the sun” is not scientific because there is no way to test it — no matter how much we search we will never find a teapot. As Popper saw it, an important difference between science and nonscience is that scientists are willing to abandon their most cherished beliefs in light of new evidence, while nonscientists are not. Thus, if someone who has been taught a certain theory in school refuses to abandon it when he learns about some counterarguments, then according to Popper he is not engaging in science but merely practicing pseudoscience.",

If we cannot achieve this balance, then we are in a state of disequilibrium, which is uncomfortable and disorienting. For example when you watch a football game for the first time you might go through a period of confusion as you try to figure out what is happening.

Still others would trace its origins back further, to earlier thinkers such as Jean Bodin or Hugo Grotius, who wrote about “natural” rights and duties that predated any particular social contract or state.

Another way is to accept feedback from others, both good and bad. A third way to maintain the balance is to be open and honest with others. If they don’t know what’s going on inside of you, they can’t help balance your negative feelings with positive ones. Finally, a fourth way to maintain the balance is to put effort into maintaining the relationship . This means doing things for the other person that may not be very gratifying for you but will make her happy.",

So we can be sure that there must be a strong evolutionary advantage to sleep, or it wouldn’t exist. Much of the research on sleep focuses on this question: What is the evolutionary advantage of sleep? There are two major theories. One is that predators go to sleep at night, so it’s safer for other animals to go to sleep at the same time, because then there are no predators around to eat them. The other theory has more to do with energy: Sleep allows us to conserve energy, so we’re fresher and more alert when we’re awake. And if you think about it in this light, it makes sense that newborns sleep as much as they do — they have so much growing and developing to do that they need all the rest they can get!",

In the United States, for example, the average cost of raising a child to age eighteen is over $200,000. The annual cost for middle-income families is about $12,000 per child. A recent survey found that 93 percent of parents in middle-income households were concerned about their ability to cover future college tuition costs.

When you look at an object, light from it enters your eye and projects an image on your retina (the part of the eye where light receptors are located). Your retina converts the light into neural signals and sends them to your brain. This information is then pieced together by millions of neurons that make up the visual cortex (part of the brain specialized for processing visual information). Each neuron does its job, and ultimately you perceive an object. This is a very complex process that occurs in less than a second. Your brain makes sense of sensory information by processing it and interpreting it. Sensation is the process of receiving information from the environment through our sensory organs: eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin. Perception occurs when we integrate, organize, and interpret what we have sensed. We create meaning out of sensation.",

The result was an outbreak of diseases that had previously been almost unknown among humans — specifically, malnutrition and rickets, which were caused by the new tight-fitting corsets that women wore to achieve fashionable figures. The corset profoundly limited breathing and blood flow and put such pressure on internal organs that digestion was disturbed.

As a result, we’re pretty good at stating our views in a way that makes them easy for other people to understand and respond to. But there is an exception: when we are talking to other philosophers. When it comes to talking among ourselves, our usual standards seem to go out the window. This isn’t because philosophers are bad people or because we think that what we say doesn’t matter. It’s just that, in our professional lives, we are often too concerned with being original and clever — and too afraid of being made fun of by our colleagues — to say what we really think. So instead of speaking openly and honestly, what usually happens when two philosophers get together is that they dance around each other, trying their best not to say anything worth disagreeing with until the conversation fizzles out altogether .",

This creative act is what makes live music an art form rather than simply an accurate reproduction of sounds on paper. Music is not made by ink on paper but by live people working together.

Because the speed of travel was no faster than it had been in Roman times, they could not do this by issuing orders; in many cases, they did not even know what was happening in remote parts of their empires. Instead, they used a combination of intimidation and rewards to secure the loyalty of local rulers. These vassals, in turn, managed the affairs of their territories, using a mix of taxation and patronage to win over local populations. In such diverse entities as Ming China, the Ottoman Empire, or Mughal India, emperors were barely visible figures who rarely traveled outside their capital cities and who communicated with many of their subjects only through intermediaries. The political scientist Benedict Anderson has dubbed these premodern polities “imagined communities,” because they were held together by an imagined sense of common identity rather than by face-to-face relationships among rulers and ruled.",

Sustaining an enterprise while only focusing on one of those three legs of the stool will lead to disaster. With respect to environmental decisions, this means that while certain actions may be profitable in the short run (e.g., clear-cutting all trees on a mountain to gain a one-time profit), they are not sustainable in the long run. Similarly, a policy that is environmentally sound but drives all businesses out of town because they can’t turn a profit also isn’t sustainable in the long run. The best solutions are those that balance all three factors: people, planet, and profits. All must be considered independently and together at all times for sustainability to be achieved .",

So how can we say that Dakar has a tropical climate when it depends on something as variable as wind? Indeed, the very definition of climate as a city’s “average weather” over thirty or more years seems to require us to think of atmospheric properties as somehow separate from those of the place itself. Or does it? For surely one could argue that there is no such thing as a climate without weather and, likewise, no such thing as weather without climate.

In theory, one should be able to trade off between these two effects by taxing the profits of multinationals and giving subsidies to local firms.

In fact, there is no longer any question about whether the body and the mind are connected. The mind and body are not just connected; they are interwoven in ways we are just beginning to understand. We now know that our perceptions of our world and our place within it have a direct effect on how we feel on both the inside and outside. This mind-body connection is particularly evident in how we respond to infections or injury. For example, when you have an infection that causes your temperature to rise, you feel sick. Your thoughts become sluggish, you don’t feel like getting out of bed, and all you want to do is sleep. This makes sense because these symptoms force you to stop everything else you’re doing and rest so that your immune system can focus all its energy on fighting off the infection.",

If the marginal benefits outweigh the marginal costs, I will eat the cookie. If not, I won’t. The concept of marginalism is useful in explaining resource allocation because it allows us to understand how people make choices as well as why they make choices. For example, if you choose a movie over a book, we know that you expect to gain more from watching the movie than you would from reading the book. We also know that you could have had both, but chose not to have them both because you expected that your enjoyment from having another of one or another of the other would be less than having nothing more of either.",

Heavy clay soils hold water best, but may remain saturated for days after a rain, making it difficult for plant roots to draw oxygen from air spaces in the soil. By contrast, sandy soils drain freely but hold very little water; so unless they are irrigated frequently, crops dry out and yield poorly.

        "full_paragraph": "Ethology is the study of animal behavior, and one of the first things it teaches us is that there are many ways to communicate. In fact, animals in a population often use all of them. Some are visual, such as when a dog bares its teeth or lowers its head. Others are auditory, like the low growl that acts as a warning signal to stay away. And some are pure body language: those same dogs might engage in a playful dance where they jump from side to side and bark excitedly. Still others incorporate smell, like the scent marking that cats use to advertise their territory. No matter what form they take, these signals are all part of a common social language that helps groups function effectively and smoothly. When an animal gets too close to another’s food source or invades its territory, for example, the threatened individual knows how to send a “back off!” signal without actually having to fight.",

In many societies, however, this also has led to increasing distancing from elderly family members who can no longer be cared for by their middle-aged children because they are working or live far away. Moreover, advances in communication technology have made it easy to stay in touch with family members and friends at a distance, thereby reducing the need to live near one’s grown children for companionship and care. At the same time, however, there has been a growing crisis of elder care around the world, as more and more older adults require assistance with daily living and health care.",

Instead of taking action to save my portfolio from these bad investments, I preferred to ignore them and hope the problems would go away.

The second method of sound localization is used when we hear a sound with only one ear, as when we are lying down with our head resting on one side or when we listen to an iPod through one earpiece. In this case, we use monaural localization and determine the location of the source by using comparisons with previous experience to assess how far away and in what direction a particular kind of sound usually comes from.

Researchers observed that dolphins could accelerate their swimming speed as much as 60 percent when they started porpoising. They also measured that dolphins had to porpoise for a distance of at least 1,000 meters to save more energy than swimming constantly just below the surface. Finally, it was discovered that dolphins can control their rate of porpoising by listening to the pressure waves made by their bodies as they contact the water’s surface and adjusting their muscle movements accordingly.",

Dogs without homes were destroyed at the end of this period, and those that had been reclaimed went home with their owners.

This view has led to the belief that children everywhere show similar developmental trends and that cultural differences in movement are due to differences in opportunities for practice. However, recent research has shown that cultural differences in movement can be found in all stages of development, including the first year of life, before any systematic practice occurs. For example, Campos, Anderson, Barbu-Roth, Hubbard and Hertenstein conducted a study in which they observed 24 four-month-old infants from the United States (a “cultural” population) and 24 from Kenya (a “noncultural” population). The results showed that the Kenyan babies were more advanced than the American babies in numerous ways. For example, they were better able to keep their heads upright for longer periods of time and to sit steadily without falling over. The Kenyan babies also were more likely than the American babies to use their muscles to make postures that facilitated different types of manual exploration. For instance, they were more likely to stretch out their arms when reaching for an object or make a fist when picking up an object. These findings suggest that physical development is influenced by culture from the very start of life .",

And there’s a one-in-twenty chance that the result will vary even more than six points. That is not an acceptable level of accuracy for a democracy. What can be done? The answer is to simply ban all polls taken during an election campaign and substitute for them actual votes cast on Election Day. This would force everyone to concentrate on the underlying issues and would serve as an antidote for media obsession with who’s ahead and who’s behind — which seems an especially appropriate remedy when presented in this particular book.",

You will see the dark patch grow much less dark as your eyes adapt to the dim light, but if you stare at the paper while turning on a bright light, the patch will become much darker during the first few seconds of exposure to the bright light. The explanation for this effect is that in dim light, your cones adapt to the darkness by becoming nearly maximally sensitive (considerably more sensitive than rods even). So, when you turn on a bright light, it takes your cones several seconds to stop signaling darkness. In bright light, however, your rods become maximally sensitive, so when you turn off the light, they take several seconds to stop signaling brightness.",

This marriage between economics and psychology has produced a new field called behavioral economics. The key assumption behind behavioral economics is that the rationality of economic agents is bounded in a way that the traditional economic model ignores.

A lot of important mathematics deals with symmetry — for example, group theory, topology, and differential geometry — but what does this have to do with biology? The answer is that symmetry can arise in living things as well. That might not be immediately obvious, because organisms often have lumps and bumps that look nothing like a circle. But when we look more closely at these details, we sometimes find that they are due to simple symmetrical patterns. For example, the branching structure of blood vessels is remarkably regular — each branch divides into two new branches — and this regularity reflects a deep mathematical principle called self-similarity.",

In 2002, the American Academy of Microbiology recommended that the concept of species be abandoned in favour of a new one: ‘the unit of bacterial diversity’. A similar idea was floated at the beginning of the twenty-first century by one of the most influential microbiologists, Norman R. Pace. He suggested that we should consider each bacterium as like a person, and speak of human biota rather than human species. Just as every person has an individual pattern of features that can be used to distinguish them from all others, so does every bacterium. The best way to define a bacterium is by listing its distinctive molecular features rather than trying to fit it into a pre-existing system.",

In 1873, the United States Congress passed the Coinage Act and stopped using silver as a standard for currency. Although many blamed this act for instigating a decline in silver prices, the real threat to silver was technological change in photography. Prior to the 1880s, silver halide was used for photography, but with the invention of gelatin dry plates and film, which required a different type of technology, demand for silver declined precipitously. As a result, during a time when Edwardian England had its largest empire and its largest navy and it was also rapidly expanding its colonies in Africa and Asia, there was not enough money available to purchase enough goods to feed growing populations. The British Empire became increasingly dependent on foreign food imports as well as other raw materials from around the world. In such a context, people naturally began to worry that Britain would eventually run out of money and be unable to finance its empire.",

The most serious and well-documented problems have occurred in traditional coastal pond systems where there is an imbalance between the quantities of nutrients supplied to the system and the quantities removed by the crops. This has resulted in environmental pollution due to excessive nutrient discharge, particularly nitrogen and phosphorus, excessive organic matter deposition, eutrophication, algal blooms, and oxygen depletion. In these cases, aquaculture has an inherent impact on ecosystems. By contrast, recirculating systems can be designed to minimize such impacts. There are also intermediate cases in which water exchange is limited but not completely excluded. Here, impacts depend on how close the system is to a natural equilibrium state with respect to nutrient recycling. Careful management can reduce nutrient discharge while carbon dioxide removal and oxygen uptake can be controlled by gas exchange with the atmosphere.",

He had discovered a relationship between himself and certain features of nature that could be controlled by him.

The simple answer is that the cells in your body are equipped with DNA repair mechanisms. Your genetic information is stored in a molecule called DNA, which is made up of two long strings called nucleotide chains. Each nucleotide chain contains a sequence of molecules called bases. There are four different kinds of bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). Before a cell divides into two daughter cells, it makes a copy of its DNA so that each daughter cell has an identical set of genetic instructions. This copying process is not always perfect, so errors sometimes occur — A might be copied as G, for example, or T might be copied as C. These errors can accumulate over time and cause the cell to malfunction or die.",

These processes combine to drive an intricate dance between changes in colony size, expansion rate and genetic variation that depend on both what happens within them (for example how fast they grow) and their interactions with other colonies (for example how far they disperse).",

They say that their role is to present the facts and that it is the role of politicians to make decisions about what to do. But there are two problems with this view. The first is that the scientific facts don’t speak for themselves. Facts are always interpreted and they can be interpreted in different ways. If scientists don’t engage in the debate, their work may be misrepresented — by politicians, or by others who want to use it for their own ends. So scientists have a professional duty to ensure that their work is presented accurately and fairly in any policy debate. The second problem with leaving policy debates to politicians is that, in practice, politics often trumps science. There are many examples of politicians ignoring scientific advice when it doesn’t suit them, or commissioning scientific advice only after they have decided what they want to do. Scientists who want to see policies based on evidence can’t just sit back and hope that politicians will take responsibility for making it so.",

But it is not just a matter of interpretation. The image of Brahms’s last symphony as death-haunted is imprinted on almost every page of the score. The first movement begins with a falling figure used by Handel and in many operas to suggest death; the second is dedicated to the memory of Brahms’s mother; the third has been seen as a requiem for a close friend; while in the finale, which returns to the key in which everything began, all we can hear are fragments of an old folk song, “I once had a horse.” If we have been given a vivid picture of life in all its energy, here we glimpse nothing but empty spaces.",

A mouse is 40 times more likely to get cancer than a human being. The reason is that big animals have longer lives and so more time for mutations to accumulate. The risk of getting cancer is directly proportional to the number of cells in an animal’s body, but not to the size or weight of the animal.

But if the liquid cools quickly enough to prevent its components from adopting their usual crystalline pattern, they become “frozen” in place in a jumbled, disordered arrangement that is typical of most glasses.

They discovered that if you make horizontal lines converge toward a single point on the horizon line and vertical lines converge toward one or another vanishing point, you can create an illusion of depth. Early in this process , painters used only one vanishing point, which created a flat effect. They then discovered that if they used two vanishing points and started to develop a sense of perspective, they could create an illusion of depth. They also discovered that much depends upon where you put your principal vanishing point: if you put it close to the viewer’s eye level, you get a sense of immediacy and intimacy; if you put it far away from the viewer’s eye level, you get an effect of distance and space.",

The person who did best would be declared the winner. But by the 20th century, as growth in science accelerated, contests started to be organized differently. In place of one big contest with many people competing against each other, there came many small contests with one or two people competing against nature. This shift has given rise to an attitude in which everyone is a winner. Who’s going to argue with that? But when we say that everyone is a winner, what we really mean is that no one is.

Mutations are genetic changes that create new alleles, while recombination shuffles existing alleles to generate new combinations of them. Recombination is an important source of genetic diversity, but it is not the only one. The introduction of new alleles via mutation is an important source of variation, too. When a new mutation occurs in a population, it is likely to end up in a low-fitness individual who will leave few descendants. Still, if the mutation is not too deleterious and if it happens in a large population, there will be enough individuals for the mutant allele to persist and potentially spread throughout the population. The longer time has passed since the origin of the mutant allele, and the larger the population size, the more likely it is for the allele to have reached high frequency in the population and even become fixed in all individuals.",

In later years, city parks would become places for recreation, where people could play games or have picnics with their families. The concrete playgrounds of postwar America were a direct response to this need for space for recreation. Most recently, city planners have begun to think about the environmental services these large areas of green offer.

It has been suggested that birds might use social learning to compensate for this. They could do this by watching how other members of their group respond to predators, and then copying them.

In fact, each time Ford brought in one robot, it laid off six workers; and over a ten-year period, the company reduced its workforce from 250,000 to 100,000 employees.",

Cinema “resembles” the real world, but it is not the real world; the way things appear in a film is different from the way they appear in reality. The illusion of reality is offered to us, but it is based on nothing more than our willingness to succumb to the illusion. Film theory has always been concerned with exposing this “lie” which constitutes cinema: by showing that film images are “constructed,” i.e., that they are the result of specific choices (camera position, lighting, etc.), film theory claims that there is no such thing as “objective” cinema but only a multitude of possible points-of-view. The aim of realism in cinema is thus to make us believe that we are seeing a given situation from an objective point-of-view, whereas we are actually seeing it from a very subjective point-of-view; what makes realism possible is our belief in it.",

When we take action to reduce the amount of mercury that gets into the environment, we protect our own health as well as the health of others around the world.

The wild ancestors of today’s sheep are considerably smaller than their domesticated descendants. The magnitude of these changes has been so great that some scientists have proposed a new geological era called the Anthropocene. This suggested new era would be defined by the considerable impact that humans have had on Earth’s geology and ecosystems. While there are many different ways to measure such an impact, one way is to compare the net change in biomass between two points in time. By this measure we live in an era when human cultural evolution has had the greatest impact on biomass of any species that has ever lived on Earth.",

Because it’s this act of subtraction — the selective elimination of undesirable features — that gives rise to superior materials. For example, in ancient times, glass was made by heating crushed quartz with an alkali such as soda ash. The resulting material was strong but brittle and had a tendency to shatter into dangerous shards. Then glassblowers discovered that they could make it both stronger and safer by removing bubbles from the molten mass as they shaped it into a vessel or windowpane. The resulting product was much less likely to break when handled roughly and, if it did break, the pieces were more likely to be large and blunt rather than small and sharp .",

It has been suggested that it is due to a loss of the supportive strength of the skin as a result of maceration produced by soaking. This would allow for an unequal distribution of tension on the skin, so that when it dries, the skin wrinkles. There appears to be some evidence that this is not entirely correct, because it has been shown that wrinkling occurs even when the dermis has been blocked with local anesthetics and therefore devoid of sensation. Wrinkling does not occur in patients with lesions involving sympathetic nerves or with Raynaud’s disease, nor does it occur in areas lacking sweat glands.

In fact scientists have estimated that for some small mammals like the mouse, sleep costs them about 12% of their daily energy budget just on the risk of being eaten.

A possible explanation for this is that the buyer doesn’t know whether he or she can trust the seller to give a fair price. It’s also possible that the buyer feels more secure knowing there are other products included in the package that have been fairly priced. Hence, even if you sell only one product, it might be wise to bundle it with other items you would normally offer as separate products and quote a single price for all of them.

If you do not speak the language or know the products sold in that country, shopping becomes difficult. The same is true when it comes to advertising; if you cannot easily identify your target audience, it is difficult for your message to be effective. To increase the chances that their ads will hit their target audience, marketers have turned to niche advertising, placing ads in media that are targeted toward specific groups of people. A niche publication covers specific topics in detail. For example, a niche magazine about bird watching could offer advertisers such as binocular manufacturers or travel agencies specializing in bird-watching trips a targeted audience of potential customers who are interested in seeing birds as an important part of their leisure activities.",

It can even be used to measure the intelligence of small groups in everyday life. For instance, the research team at Carnegie Mellon University that developed a test of group intelligence conducts its research by having people sit around a table and solve problems together while being watched by researchers who code their interactions in real time. The process is then used to assess group intelligence. Some examples of the kinds of problems that these teams work on are creative design tasks such as a brainstorming exercise in which the participants have five minutes to come up with as many uses as they can for a paper clip.

It is also a behavior that is essential for the survival of species, including humans. In order to cope with new challenges, animals must develop new responses to them. This often involves restructuring the brain to make it more capable of generating these responses. For example, once birds started moving about on two legs and no longer had their wings free to use as forelimbs, they gradually developed wings that were better adapted for winged flight. Creativity, then, is not limited to humans but appears in all species that have brains capable of adaptation and learning. Consequently, understanding creativity goes hand in hand with understanding how the brain carries out this remarkable feat. Those who work on creativity and those who work on understanding the brain have much to learn from each other.",

Over the past three centuries, a series of “isms” — mercantilism, imperialism, capitalism, socialism, communism — have been paraded as the ultimate theory on which to base national and international policy. In each case the proponents of these theories have failed to appreciate their weaknesses and limitations. These ideologies were created by passionate visionaries who had no doubt about their ability to remake their societies in accordance with their dreams. However, the actual implementation of those theories often produced results that were very different from those intended by their creators. The same can be said for human rights today. Just as theorists of mercantilism or communism were overly optimistic about their respective theories, so too human-rights advocates are perhaps unduly optimistic about the promise of human rights in our international system.",

Moreover, artists often require the cooperation of others to exhibit and market their works. A gallery owner might organize an exhibition, invite critics to review it, and send out announcements in order to increase attendance at an opening reception. All this activity is normally intended to enhance the reputation and sales potential of the artist’s works by making them more visible within the art world.

Basaltic magmas are low in silica and flow easily, while rhyolitic magmas contain a high percentage of silica and are thus more viscous (thick, syrupy) and slow-flowing. Andesitic magmas fall between the extremes. The temperature of a magma also influences its behavior. In general, a hotter magma will be less viscous than a cooler one. Finally, the rate at which a magma cools affects its behavior. If it cools quickly, as when it reaches the Earth’s surface, it will solidify into an igneous rock with very small mineral crystals or no minerals at all (glass). If a magma cools slowly beneath the surface, larger crystals will form.

Herbart’s research led him to a unique theory of ideas. In Herbart’s view, ideas — which he called presentations — never go away entirely. They may be submerged in the mind and temporarily forgotten, but they are always present in some form. This is true even for individual experiences from the distant past. For example, when I eat an apple, I have a direct experience of that apple, but when I later recall that experience in my imagination, my idea of the apple is more abstract than my original perception; it is less vivid or detailed. As time passes and my memory fades, the idea becomes even more abstract and loses its original vividness.",

But on closer inspection it becomes clear that the scribe did not carry out this heavy lifting unaided. Instead he used a two-wheeled cart to help him with his task. The use of wheels for transportation was one of the most important inventions in human history, yet we have no clear idea where and when it was made. We do know that by 3000 BC wheeled vehicles were in common usage throughout Mesopotamia and Egypt, but they do not appear in Greece until about 2000 BC, in China until about 1500 BC and finally in much of sub-Saharan Africa until well into historical times.",

This idea is related to romantic views of artistic creation that see great works as springing fully formed from the creator’s head, without need for revision or editing. The fact is that great works take time to create and most composers have been known to revise their work several times before they are satisfied with it.",

For example, if every individual in a population has two lethal genes, the average number of offspring required to maintain a stable population is 4. This number is derived from the fact that each individual must produce at least two surviving offspring in order to replace itself, but because half of all zygotes will be inviable because of lethal genes, an individual must actually have four offspring on average in order to replace itself. If more than half the zygotes are inviable, an individual must produce even more than four offspring to replace itself. Thus, as the proportion of individuals with lethal genes increases, so does the number of offspring required to maintain a stable population. It has been suggested that this may be one reason why many organisms have more than two offspring per parent.",

But once you have combined all of the ingredients in a recipe, they are going to be further manipulated with heat or some other process before you actually eat them. And that’s where things get tricky. When you bake a cake, you pour batter into a pan and stick it in a hot oven for 30 minutes or so.

The idea of using multiple spindles to spin threads became very popular and a number of machines were developed to perform this task — like Richard Arkwright’s water-driven spinning frame and Samuel Crompton’s “Mule,” which combined features of both Hargreaves’s and Arkwright’s machines.

In the simplest animals, we now know that there are cells that make up a body (like our organs) and other cells that police and protect this body by attacking intruders.

It was reasoned that people applied whatever they learned from television to situations in real life.

Essential oils, the quintessence of a plant’s medicinal properties, make up a major part of the gift that plants bring to us. The essential oil of a plant is its distilled “soul.” It is so called because it contains its essence, and it is obtained by distillation or cold expression of the plant’s leaves, flowers, stems, bark, or roots. Essential oils are volatile, meaning that when left open they quickly evaporate into the air. They are concentrated in their constituents: from one drop to one pound can be extracted from a single plant. The distillate is so intense that it takes 60,000 rose blossoms to make just one ounce of rose oil! And yet it still possesses all of the vital energy and healing qualities present in the entire plant itself.",

The spring delivers the water at a constant rate, and villagers use it for drinking, growing crops, and watering animals. Imagine that in recent years the village has grown, and the amount of water used has begun to exceed the amount provided by the spring. There are two ways to deal with this problem: find another source of water or reduce usage. In principle, there are probably many ways to increase the amount of water available to the village, such as digging wells or capturing rainwater. However, if all these resources combined still do not deliver enough water for everyone, then eventually some other solution must be found. For example, villagers might have to give up growing some crops or perhaps learn to collect rainwater in rooftop cisterns. This simple story illustrates several important features of sustainability.",

And so they have argued that artists who set out to address real social conditions in their work were at best activists or propagandists. At worst, they were not artists at all but rather journalists. Even when left-wing politics have been fashionable in the art world, there has been no agreement about what the role of artists might be in addressing real social problems.

Finally, when an object has no more heat left to give off, it’s said to be at absolute zero. At this point all motion within its molecules stops completely. Even space isn’t that cold.

It’s unclear what these clock cells do in cicadas, but they must be important because they keep perfect time without input from light or any other environmental cues.

This means that when there is friction between the two people who are most important to them, they spend more time worrying about how they should behave than about being happy themselves.

The tone serves as a warning; when it sounds, the dog has 5 seconds to jump over the barrier into the other chamber before he receives an electric shock. At first, the dog jumps ineffectively and receives several shocks. But gradually he learns that jumping over the barrier prevents him from being shocked. After many trials, he becomes an expert at avoiding shocks by jumping immediately after hearing the tone. In this simple setting, there is little doubt that something more than simple reinforcement by rewards and punishments is going on.

According to Aristotle, all substances are composed of four elements: earth, air, fire, and water. He believed that all minerals contain the potential to achieve their perfection as gold through a process of refining. This view was based on empirical observations: ores become shinier or more lustrous when they are heated and smelted. Also, by removing impurities (such as sulfur) from certain ores, it is possible to increase their gold content by weight (though not their value). The alchemical idea was that by repeatedly “cooking” minerals with different substances and heating them over a flame for a long time (a process called digestion), it would be possible to accelerate their natural refinement process and obtain large quantities of pure gold.",

Of course, there are some differences — the legs tend to be associated with working harder than the arms and shoulders, and this is reflected in the ratings of perceived exertion. But overall the correlations between measures of perception of effort on different machines are quite high. That is important because it suggests that even when there is no conscious awareness of what the body is doing, we can still perceive how hard we are working, and that this informs our decisions to continue or to stop work. If this were not so then it would be possible for someone who was asked to run a certain distance on a treadmill to pretend that he was running faster than he actually was by going slower but still giving a ‘full’ effort. The fact that he cannot do this shows that our perception of effort is quite closely related to how hard we are actually working.",

A series of studies conducted by Levine and colleagues (2011) found that the presence of an audience improved the performance of skilled musicians when they were asked to play a familiar piece in an unfamiliar way; for example, by playing a composition on a toy piano instead of a full-sized instrument. However, audiences can also hinder performance when one is learning or not yet proficient at something. Researchers have found that children who are learning to ride a bike learn faster without an audience (Kostrubala, 1992).

With so much variety and such a low price, it’s hard to make a decision about what to eat and how much to eat in advance. Inducing overpurchasing works because we have a tendency to underestimate our future satiation points when we buy things that we don’t need immediately.

Here we might think that an end is rational if it furthers one’s well-being or happiness. The claim that one should act in such a way as to further one’s own well-being or happiness is often known as egoism .

Instead of getting drunk together, they could socialise over a cup of coffee while they discussed politics, commerce and science. It is unlikely that many women would have wanted to take part in these discussions even if they had been allowed inside the male-only coffeehouses, but they were also excluded from other social spaces where they might have been able to meet with men without chaperones.

To double production, a rancher would need to hire more cowhands, but eventually he or she would run out of room for them to work. If 1000 cowhands were working with 5,000 cows, they could hardly move around at all! The same principle applies on the other side: As you reduce the number of workers on the job, output falls. However, if you reduce the labor force to zero there is still some level of production due to machinery and organization. This defines productivity in the economic sense: output per unit of input.",

For example, even though the jasmine odour is often described as being ‘natural’, the synthetic version is actually preferred over the natural one. This preference for synthetic scents over natural scents has been found in several studies and has led some researchers to wonder if artificial odours are really all that artificial after all. They note that many of the chemicals used in artificial scents are extracted from nature, so even in a synthetic scent one can still find traces of nature. They also point out that some animals have developed the ability to use man-made odours in their interactions with other animals. So what makes an odour seem ‘natural’ to us may not just be a matter of its chemical composition but may also be linked to its meaning or function .",

The new breed of food manufacturers in America adopted a number of key strategies in order to persuade people that eating was something that should be done all day long, and not just at mealtimes. One was simply to start telling people that this was what should be done. Advertising and magazines started to run articles on how important snacking was, even for children.

This was not surprising behavior. However, as Skinner continued his experiments, he began to notice something unexpected: The birds’ superstitious behaviors were not always clearly linked to the delivery of food. In some cases, a pigeon might turn its head or flap its wings shortly before getting fed. In other cases, it might perform a particular set of movements after being fed but before getting hungry again. Despite the fact that these behaviors were not reinforced in any way by the delivery of food, they quickly became part of the birds’ repertoires. In effect, the pigeons had developed superstitions: They believed that their actions could influence whether or not they were fed, even when there was no actual connection between what they did and whether they got fed.",

Remarkably, a colony behaves like a single organism. It has no central control: There are no managers, no bosses, no foreman giving out orders. Instead, the ants use local information to determine what to do and when to do it. For example, the decision to build a new nest is made by individual workers: they go scout out the environment and decide whether to move the colony. When an ant discovers a good site for a new nest, it returns to the old nest and increases its rate of carrying baby ants (that is, larva) from one place to another. Other worker ants notice this increase and begin also carrying baby ants at higher rates. Soon all the worker ants are moving the larva to the new nest site. No one ant knows what is happening; each is simply responding to local information about how fast other workers are carrying larvae.",

Distributive bargaining involves haggling over price, with each party trying to get as much as possible without giving anything away.

That is how we are able to think about the future, and how we are also able to remember our past experiences and learn from them.

For example, some species of plants stop photosynthesis and go dormant if there is not enough phosphorus available to build DNA and other important cell molecules. In order for these dormant plants to start growing again, something must happen to increase the amount of phosphorus in the soil.

The second is that we live in a media-driven society and our minds are constantly bombarded by information of all kinds. We are always required to attend to several things at once, and so our minds have become more adept at multitasking and solving problems quickly.

In an analog signal, the value of a quantity such as voltage or current varies continuously. In a digital signal, however, that value is quantized and can take on only a finite number of possible values. To convert an analog signal into digital form, we first divide the set of all possible values for the signal into a finite number of subintervals. We then assign to each subinterval oneof a finite number of possibledigital words. A digitized version of the analog signal is then obtained by “rounding”the actual value to its nearest subinterval and transmittingthe associated digital word for that subinterval. The reverse process — convertinga digital signal back toanalog form — is also important in many applications and can be realized usinganalog-to-digital converters(ADCs) and digital-to-analog converters(DACs).",

Over the centuries these laws were modified to reflect changing social attitudes toward animals. Prior to the nineteenth century, most states had animal cruelty laws, but enforcement was spotty and punishment was usually light. In 1866 the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) was founded by Henry Bergh, a wealthy New Yorker who had been exposed to ideas about animal protection during a trip he made to Europe. The ASPCA not only actively enforced animal protection laws in New York but also lobbied for stricter state legislation throughout the country. By 1900 all states had passed animal cruelty laws that included heavy fines and imprisonment as possible penalties for abusers and required law enforcement officers to enforce them.",

One way to get around these problems is to use a large number of observers and a large number of participants.

Although these advantages were important in the evolution of bird flight, it is now clear that a major driving force behind its evolution was the need for enhanced capabilities in predation. The large size of the brain relative to body mass in birds is evidence that they are highly intelligent vertebrates. This suggests that their ancestors developed an increased ability to catch prey by out-thinking them (a prediction which is supported by some recent fossil discoveries), before evolving an increased ability to catch prey by out-running them.

The immune system does this by detecting and responding to molecules that are found only on pathogens. These molecules are called antigens. The immune system is so good at detecting foreign molecules that it often responds to proteins from pollen, food, and other allergens. In such cases, the immune response is beneficial only in the sense that it is doing what it was designed to do. In other words, the symptoms of allergies are unintended side effects of a normally useful trait. Drug allergy is another example in which the immune response is harmful rather than helpful. A small fraction of all drugs stimulates an immune response that causes illness or tissue damage in some patients.",

These differences in earnings may seem unfair to many people. On the other hand, market economies have an advantage when it comes to fairness: A market economy rewards people for their productivity. The dentist earns more than the dental assistant because she is more skilled and can handle more complicated procedures. Movie stars earn more than nurses because they command large audiences.

The results indicated that when people thought that others were also pulling on the rope, they did not pull as hard as when they thought that only they themselves were pulling. It also turned out that the reason for this reduced effort was not just that the participants didn’t feel like working. Instead, the researchers found that when people are in a group and their individual performances cannot be evaluated separately from those of others, they believe that their own level of effort is not important to the group’s success. They think that “someone else” will work harder if necessary. Thus because individual contributions seem less important in a group than they do when working alone, people loaf in groups.",

In addition, research has shown that people exposed to novel foods in a social setting will like these foods more than people who are exposed alone ― even when those who eat alone receive payment for their consumption!

A few thousand years later, breeders learned they could concentrate the most valuable traits within a species by crossbreeding two individual plants with those desirable attributes. This was accomplished by simply planting them next to each other and releasing pollen from one plant’s flowers onto the other plant’s stigmas, thereby fertilizing the plant. The result would be a new generation of plants that combined the best characteristics of both parents. It was like creating nature’s own version of a super-plant.

The Danish astronomer Olaus Roemer used observations of the moons of Jupiter from Earth to time the apparent delay in their passage when the Earth and Jupiter were at different points in their orbits, due to the finite speed of light. This led to an improved estimate, but it wasn’t until 1850 that the French physicist Armand Fizeau made the first direct measurement of c by timing how long it took for light to travel a known distance between rapidly rotating cogwheels.

They are formed by millions of tiny coral animals called polyps, which excrete skeletons of calcium carbonate. Over thousands of years, these skeletons create massive underwater structures, teeming with life. Among the creatures that live on coral reefs are starfish. In general, starfish eat only dead or dying coral polyps. However, a few species are able to eat live coral polyps and can multiply quickly if local predators disappear. The crown-of-thorns starfish is one such predator.It is native to the Indo-Pacific region and contains a neurotoxin that makes it deadly to most other animals. Outbreaks occur occasionally and may last for several years, during which time huge numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish eat their way across vast areas of reef. These outbreaks can destroy up to 90% of living corals in an area, leading to a loss of biodiversity as well as a collapse of the physical structure of the reef itself.",

Irrigation systems are expensive to construct and vulnerable to both sabotage and poor maintenance. They require a large labor force to build and maintain, but neither peasants nor nobles can be taxed heavily on their output or they will leave. Furthermore, peasants need a reliable source of water for their crops. This combination of requirements leads to the development of a strong central government with both the power and the incentive to control water resources and hence regional agriculture.

When these needs are met, social needs (friendship and belonging) emerge. Once these are satisfied, self-esteem needs emerge: people want to feel good about themselves.

In our increasingly interconnected world where people and goods move more rapidly across previously impervious borders, multi-drug-resistant organisms can spread globally within a matter of days to several months.",

For example, when teens are lectured about the dangers of smoking by a teacher or parent, they may react negatively to the message and resist giving up smoking. As a result of their negative reaction to the message, they may be less likely to participate in future health classes or read materials that discourage smoking. To avoid these negative consequences of health education, health educators should work to ensure that all audiences perceive value in the information being offered. When information is provided in a way that audience members consider valuable and credible, they will be more likely to pay attention and less likely to reject the new information.",

This point can be illustrated by the case of Brazil’s large hydroelectric projects. In the early 1980s, the Brazilian government built dams to generate electricity for its rapidly expanding industrial sector. These dams produced reservoirs that altered river drainage and water flow patterns. The reservoirs also changed local microclimates and encouraged the growth of snails and other organisms that carry schistosomiasis as a vector-transmitted disease. It was not long before schistosomiasis spread throughout the region. In this case, we see that large-scale political-economic decisions (to build hydroelectric dams) resulted in fundamental changes in local environmental conditions, which in turn produced significant health risks for people living in the area.",

As a result, scientists had a pretty good idea of what they would be looking for before they started looking, and this made their search much easier.

It has been realized that what really matters for the evolution of cooperation is the way that benefits and costs are distributed among individuals.

These new kinds of bacteria were not very good at their job, though; they produced a lot of hydrogen sulfide as they broke down the sewage.

One night after a week of beatings, Risner heard an American voice outside his cell. “I’m from the 3rd Marine Division,” the voice said. “We’re gonna get you out.” The Marine had planned it well. He had done some reconnaissance and found the limits of security around Risner’s prison cell. At midnight he tossed a rope over the wall and pulled Risner over it as well.",

This protein abounds in mitochondria and gives brown adipose tissue a high capacity for heat production. When stimulated by the nervous system, the brown fat cells allow protons to leak across the inner mitochondrial membrane without making ATP. This type of thermogenesis is called nonshivering thermogenesis, because it doesn’t involve the muscle contractions required for shivering thermogenesis. In human infants, brown fat accounts for about 5 to 6 percent of total body weight and dissipates about 30 percent of the energy from food (compared with only about 10 percent by adults).

As such, there were few acts or conditions that could be described as private. Privacy came to be defined in opposition to this publicness; it emerged as a place apart from the public world where one could escape view or disturbance by others. It was believed that when an individual retreated into the private sphere he was entitled to be free from intrusion by anyone or anything outside that sphere, including the government.

Now suppose that Jones does A and that Black does not interfere with Jones’s decision to do A. Even though Jones had no alternative but to do A, he acted freely and intentionally because no one forced him to do it. So it seems that he had free will even though he could not have done otherwise than what he did.",

The brains of babies are not fully developed at birth, as a result of the size limitations imposed by the birth canal and the physical demands of human pregnancy and childbirth. As a consequence, human babies are born with underdeveloped brains compared to other species and require a period of time outside the womb to complete their physical development. The brain continues to be shaped by its environment throughout this childhood period, and some aspects of brain development continue into adolescence. It is a mistake, however, to think that because the newborn baby’s brain is immature it is therefore a blank slate with no inherent capacities or predispositions. On the contrary, there is increasing evidence that much of our cognitive architecture is predetermined by evolution to enable us to acquire the knowledge we need for survival in complex social groups.",

For example, at the height of its empire in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the Dutch East India Company profited from its dominance over trade with Asia by selling maps of the region. To do so, however, it required that all maps it published be based on secret charts created by its navigators that showed accurate coastlines but fictitious internal details. When a map was released that did not follow these guidelines, the company destroyed it. The reason for this secrecy is clear: if other nations knew what resources were available where, they could compete more effectively with the Dutch in obtaining them. Today there are still many examples of how art and maps can be used as tools of imperialism or resistance to imperialism.",

This was Aristotle’s claim, and it is one of the few claims he made that has gone undisputed. The American Declaration of Independence states that we have a right to the pursuit of happiness. But what is happiness? It can’t be reduced to pleasure or satisfaction, because there are many things we are glad to have done even though they gave us no pleasure at all. Perhaps it’s better described as flourishing, as living a good life. Part of what that involves is feeling pleasure and satisfaction, part of it involves being loved and respected by those around us, but part of it involves living up to our own standards for what makes a life good. A happy life, in this sense, requires the development and exercise of our capacities — physical, emotional and intellectual — in a way that allows us to make the best use possible of them.",

The reason for this is that fish eat water fleas, and the longer-spined water fleas are more likely to survive long enough to reproduce. However, when fish are absent, water fleas do not need to have long spines to escape predators, so they do not invest energy in growing long spines. Thus, the development of long spines in water fleas is an adaptive response to environmental information (the presence of fish). But there is a cost associated with having long spines: it takes energy to grow them and keep them maintained. So if a population of water fleas were constantly exposed to fish, natural selection would favor longer and longer spine lengths, until eventually the costs would outweigh the benefits and spine length would be maximized.",

Yet cities also face major challenges: inequality within cities is high and rising, many cities face declining infrastructure and services, and a rapidly growing number of people in cities across the world lack affordable housing. Moreover, climate change poses an existential threat to many aspects of urban life: increased risk from extreme weather events; rising temperatures that will increase air pollution, heat-related mortality, and energy use for cooling; and sea-level rise that threatens coastal areas with more frequent flooding. Addressing these challenges will require radical transformations in how we live in and organize our cities around the world. But changing life in cities is difficult because people who live there come from different backgrounds, hold different values, and have different ideas about what kinds of changes would make their lives better.

We would have to forgo many of the things that we enjoy today. The production possibilities model demonstrates the logic behind this principle. When individuals specialize in producing particular goods and services, they can achieve higher levels of consumption. The key is that trade enables these higher levels of consumption to occur by allowing one individual’s surplus output to be exchanged with others who have their own surplus production. In this way, both parties benefit by specializing in what they do best and exchanging their surplus production with others’ surplus production.",

A wind blowing in the same direction as a swimmer or a runner can create a significant advantage, while a headwind will slow an athlete down. It is important for officials at sporting events to measure wind speed and take it into account when recording athletes’ times and distances. Recreational athletes use the weather information in their area, such as wind speed, to help them decide when they will train. If the wind is blowing in one direction and will be at their back on the return trip, it will provide a more enjoyable experience than struggling against the wind. Athletes need to understand that, while wind direction is important in these situations, consistent winds of 15 mph or more can have a negative impact on training sessions.",

If you want to know how a war will end, you must know the political preferences of the combatants and what they are willing to accept or reject. The great Prussian also warned that “the first, the supreme, the most far-reaching act of judgment that the statesman and commander have to make is to establish . . . the kind of war on which they are embarking; neither mistaking it for, nor trying to turn it into something that is alien to its nature.” In other words, if you get your objectives wrong or engage in a form of warfare that does not suit those objectives, then you will almost certainly fail in your endeavor.",

For example, a household may have an old boiler that is very inefficient and so wants to replace it with a new one but cannot afford it. As a result they have a very high demand for heating and so spend a large shareof their income on this. However, if there are large demand-side rebounds from energy efficiency then these households may be able to afford to replace the old boiler with a new one by adopting some energy-efficient behaviours, as well as perhaps some government support.",

It requires rich soil and regular applications of manure to grow well. And it is not easy to harvest either because its stalks are brittle and snap off easily.

Ice, like all solids, resists flow due to the electrical forces holding its atoms and molecules together as a solid lattice. If you gently push on the ice, causing it to flow slowly, you are doing work on the ice. This work increases the energy in the ice’s internal degrees of freedom and warms it up slightly. The breaking of some molecular bonds releases energy, while their formation consumes energy. It takes work to break bonds and causes formation of new bonds to occur at other places; ultimately, your work creates an imbalance between bond breaking and bonding that leads to a tiny bit of melting and a tiny bit more flow. The ice thus offers you some resistance to your efforts to make it flow.",

Thanks to Earth’s rotation, the line of sight to Mars swung through an angle of about one arc minute in the time it took for light to travel from the asteroid to Earth: an angle that is maintained by our present speed and direction through space as we move around the Sun. The length of this base line is known with great accuracy, so this gives us a right-angled triangle with a known base line and an observed angle subtended at a known distance.

Instead, it should create its own reality through “counterpoint,” or an opposition between what is seen on the screen and what is heard on the soundtrack: “Sound-film has its own peculiar ‘montage’ — that of sound.” Eisenstein gives the example of a horse galloping through water. The image shows how easily the horse’s hoof comes out of the water.

I told them that if the dog went missing, we would be very sad.

In addition, they would never be allowed to have another dog or any other pet in its place.

We are always eager to see the latest movie, visit the newest restaurant, or read the most recent bestseller. But is it really the newness of such things that makes us curious, or is it the information we have about them? Researchers at Stanford University tested this question by giving people a list of forthcoming movies in order to determine how many of them they were curious to see. As expected, the participants were interested in seeing new releases. However, they were even more interested in seeing movies about which they had greater information (e.g., who was directing it, who was starring in it). This shows that although curiosity can be piqued by novelty (if something is new, you don’t know much about it), novelty itself isn’t enough to provoke curiosity. It’s what you already know about something — and how much you want to know more — that really matters.",

In his book Biophilia, Wilson argues that humans have an instinctive urge to affiliate with other forms of life, including nature, plants, animals, and other people. He states that there is nothing inherently unnatural about the modern organization and that its roots are deep in history. Wilson’s ideas are built on the work of Charles Darwin, who believed that all living organisms have evolved from a common ancestor and that all complex forms of life are interrelated in complex patterns of interaction. The idea that all living organisms are interconnected can provide a foundation for understanding why we behave as we do in organizations today.",

Thanks to new research using brain imaging, we now know that addiction involves learning from past rewards. We learn from positive outcomes that it will pay off if we repeat a behavior or action in the future. In fact, this mechanism is located in several brain regions that happen to be slower maturing areas of the teenage brain.

English, for example, has eleven basic colour terms: black, white, red, green, yellow and blue (the ‘warm’ colours) and brown, purple, pink, orange and grey (the ‘cool’ colours). Yet within each of these basic categories there are many thousands of subtle variations. In other words we have far more subtle shades and hues than we have words for them. This means that we are sometimes required to make fine discriminations between shades which we don’t have to do in other areas of perception. If everyday experience were right then we would expect memory for these shades to be very poor indeed. It turns out, however, that this is not the case at all: memory for different hues is just as good as memory for any other sort of stimulus.",

This required integrating new forms of expertise (e.g., about geology) into existing forms of local knowledge (e.g., about the local geology of a specific mine). The term was later taken up by engineers, who used it to describe complex technical systems that also incorporate high levels of social complexity.

This suggests that even in an hour’s time, when it comes to storing information in memory, older people are not doing so badly. And indeed, other studies have shown that there is little or no difference between young and old adults in remembering events from decades before.

The problem with this approach is that it can only be done so many times before viewers grow tired of an old theme dressed up in new clothing.

This is why it is important to regulate unhealthy foods. One way to do this is by increasing the price of such foods through taxation.

However, other researchers have argued that rewards can also enhance motivation as long as students are intrinsically interested in the task at hand (Cordova & Lepper, 1996). In other words, they argue that when rewards are used to reinforce behaviors that students find rewarding in the first place (e.g., providing grades for completing a project), they have a positive effect on motivation. However, when rewards are used to reinforce behaviors that students do not intrinsically find rewarding (e.g., providing money for reading a book), they have a negative effect on motivation. Researchers then distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic reinforcement: The former occurs when rewards or punishments are related to the activity itself and do not rely on any other motivating factors; the latter occurs when rewards or punishments are related to an activity but depend on external factors.",

A key part of being an effective leader is knowing when to delegate. Managers who are successful at delegating know that their main job is developing their employees. Their ultimate goal is for their staff to meet or exceed their performance standards.",

We hate losses so much that we will often take huge risks to avoid them. For example, many investors who lose money in a stock market downturn will keep their money in stocks and even buy more stocks in the hope of getting their money back. As a result, they may become even poorer than they would have been if they had sold their stocks at a loss and invested in safer assets like government bonds. Similarly, our ancestors who survived long ago were more likely to reproduce and pass on their genes if they were overly cautious about potential threats. Unlike people who did not survive because they were not cautious enough, our overcautious ancestors’ genes continue to influence our reactions to potential threats today.",

Research can be described as a blend of the rational and irrational, where the researcher uses all available knowledge to develop a hypothesis and design an experiment. This design has to be logical and conform to the rigors of good experiment methodology. However, while conducting an experiment it is necessary for the researcher to be flexible and open-minded, and prepared to change direction if unexpected observations are made. It is important that researchers are not too rigid or fixed in their thinking; this can result in them becoming defensive when their conclusions are questioned, or even when they themselves realize that they have made a mistake.",

There was a study done at Harvard University by Caroline Snow and Laura Morgan Roberts in which they discovered that students who developed “bridging capital” (new networks) while at school were more successful after graduation than other students. The study found that bridging capital led to increases in both job placement and salary offers.",

Emotion researchers have noted that the presence of other people can change the way individuals appraise or interpret situations. For example, a person who receives an unexpected award at a formal ceremony might experience more pride than if the award were received in private. Similarly, a person who receives an unexpected parking ticket might experience more anger if he/she is with other people at the time than if he/she is alone. Interpersonal influences can also operate through social comparison processes. In some social situations, being associated with particular people or groups may make an event seem more important or significant, thereby increasing the intensity of one’s emotional reactions.",

Mindful eating is a big part of how some people learn to manage their weight without dieting. By focusing on the physical sensations of hunger and fullness, they learn when to start and stop eating rather than relying on external cues such as portion sizes or calorie counts. This shift in focus can lead to an increase in satisfaction with meals without increasing food intake — a winning combination for maintaining a healthy weight.",

In short, there is no single way to do science or any other sort of scholarship. There are many ways and they often conflict with each other.

For example, it is well known that the performance of an individual artificial neuron can be captured by a linear equation with a small number of free parameters.

Although social capital has been studied and discussed in sociology journals for many years, it was only recently that it became popularized in the mainstream media. In 2000, Robert Putnam published his book Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community. He argued that Americans’ sense of belonging, civic engagement, and trust has declined during the past 40 years due to changes in work life (more time at work leaves less time for civic activities), family life (decreasingly cohesive families give rise to fewer opportunities for civic involvement), mass media (television viewing displaces time that would have otherwise been spent engaging in community activities), and other aspects of modern life.",

Your parents may have told you that smoking is bad for your health, but their own use of tobacco was far more influential on your likelihood to smoke than what they said. In this way, the influence of parental behavior is transmitted from generation to generation.",

You don’t have to go to school to learn new things. You can learn something new every day from your own experience and from others. Since everyone is unique, others will experience the same event in different ways. Their insights can enrich your own experience by giving you a fresh perspective on the world around you. Being open-minded does not mean that you don’t have any opinions or beliefs of your own; it just means that you are willing to consider other points of view and take new facts into account when forming your beliefs.",

Neoclassical economists generally assume that the only motive people have is to maximize their own utility. But this is not always the case. People often help others even when they receive nothing tangible in return. They may donate time or money to charity, help a stranded motorist, or work for a lower wage than they could get elsewhere because they believe in the employer’s mission and want to contribute to its success. Alternatively, people may help others because they expect some future benefit — such as receiving help in return from those they have helped or an enhanced reputation in their community. So while it is true that the desire to maximize one’s own utility does play a large role in many situations, it does not cover all cases of cooperation and sharing.",

This means that you should highlight the limitations and weaknesses as well as the strengths of existing work or theories. Do not take everything you read at face value; you should be prepared to question the validity of certain claims. Finally, do not confine yourself only to your own discipline for a literature review, as relevant material may exist elsewhere.

In other cases, a well-known story may be adapted for a new medium in ways that alter the original story to a greater extent than some invented stories. Adaptation is not always about simply translating an original story from one medium to another; sometimes it involves reinterpreting or even rewriting a well-known story. Part of the reason this is so is that no two media are exactly alike. Each has its own characteristics — its own strengths and weaknesses, its own conventions and standards, and so on — that shape how stories in that medium are told. As a result, stories must be changed when they are translated from one medium to another in order to make them suitable for the new medium.",

The philosopher and critic Arthur Danto has argued that there is no longer any clear distinction between painting and sculpture, which are types of visual art, and crafts such as pottery and weaving. In this view, the concept of \"art\" has been extended to embrace many activities that used to be called \"craft,\" so that \"art\" becomes a \"family resemblance\" concept whose members share some but not all features. However, the concept of \"design\" can also be extended in such a way as to merge with that of \"art.\"  A maker of beautiful furniture or jewelry may be said to be an artist rather than a designer, just as critics debate whether fashion designers are artists or simply designers. The difficulty here may lie in distinguishing the aspects of beauty from those of utility in those objects that have both properties.",

In contrast, water (the substance we need most for life) will kill us if we consume too much of it in a short period of time.

But this is neither possible nor desirable. We cannot live without each other and dependence on others is not a problem in itself. The goal is not to become independent of others but rather to become interdependent with them --- to strike a balance between meeting our own needs and helping others meet theirs.

Children who have strong visual-spatial abilities can learn from looking at things in the world around them. For instance, when children first learn about letters and numbers, they can begin by looking at signs while riding in a car or while walking around town.

Some of these factors may be more or less relevant than others. Appearance is not always a reliable guide to trustworthiness. On the other hand, what someone says can sometimes give us good reason to trust them. If I tell you that I will meet you in London at 2 p.m., and if I am in a position to do so (that is, if I have access to transport), and unless something unforeseen happens (like an accident or illness) then you probably have good reason to trust me.

Similarly, access to clean water is dependent on healthy watersheds, aquifers, rivers and lakes — all part of the environmental web.

A society with high levels of income inequality will necessarily have high levels of welfare inequality, but the reverse need not be true. It is possible to have low income inequality but high welfare inequality if the distribution of leisure time — and job quality — is unequal.
